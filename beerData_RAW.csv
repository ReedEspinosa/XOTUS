Note this yeast (wyeast 1968) activity is low and very little carbon dioxide is given off. This yeast is very flocculant and it will leave bottled beer flat, so just add a small amount of any other yeast with the dextrose at bottling to get good carbonation, however it produces a very smooth character to the brew that makes it worth using. 



Primary fermentation is complete in 4 days. Rack to secondary and add 1/2 cascade (dry hop). Bottle after ~ 7 days in secondary using 2/3 cup dextrose, and being careful to add additional yeast a 1/4 tsp of any dry yeast is plenty."

You may then try partly to sterilize in some way. Don't try to sterilize by heating: this imparts a cooked taste to the cider. You could try a very small quantity of sodium metabisulphite for a few hours (see recipes for wine-making from fruit). Pitch the yeast (and I would add some yeast nutrient) and ferment for about 2-4 weeks. This can be drunk immediately (""rough cider"") or racked into secondary for up to 3 months. Don't worry about the clarity: it's unlikely to drop clear, due to all the pectins. If you're really confident about your sterilization, cider matures well in bottle. 



One way of cutting down on contamination would be to boil a small quantity of the juice and make up a starter with the yeast - this large inoculum should compete out any unwanted strains, and the cooked taste from the small volume of starter won't be noticeable."

The finishing hops were added with 15 minutes left in the boil. The wort was cooled to under 100 F using an ice bath before straining. The wort was strained through a fine mesh strainer. (This took a while due to the hops and other precipitate). The yeast was activitated with about an ounce of dark brown sugar in a cup of water before starting to brew. The activated yeast was pitched into the wort and the fermentation was started with a blowout hose. Switched to a water lock after three days. The fermentation was finished in a week. Dissolved the dark brown sugar in two cups of boiling water and added to the beer after cooling to room temp. Bottled into 22 oz. bottles and aged 3 and 1/2 weeks."

Dough in grains when temp is 168 to achieve 153 mash temp. Hold for one hour. I do batch sparging, so I verlauf until clear, then drain off the first running ( usually about 1.75 gal). Then add 2 gallons of 192 degree water, should hit 168 with no problem. Give mash a good stir then a brief rest before draining second running. Repeat batch sparging until you get 6.25 gallons of pre boil. Note: I have increased the efficiency dramatically by giving a 10 minute rest on each batch sparge, but would recommend just rinsing the grain without any rest. The end result of the higher efficiency is a bit heavy to drink, but if you're on a mission to get drunk, maybe you'd like it.



60 minute boil with the hop additions, rapidly chill to 76. Pitch yeast and aerate wort. 5 days primary, 5-7 days secondary. Keg or bottle and enjoy!"

Boil extract, 1 lb of honey and 3 oz of hops in 2 gallons of water for 1 hour. Make sure the other gallons of water have been placed in the freezer to get the water very cold. If you are using a full boil and a wort cooler this will not be necessary. Add 3 oz hops and Irish moss the last 10 minutes. (If you do not have a wort cooler use the following steps) Place primary fermenter (30L Plastic with drain valve) in sink with ice around the sides and add 3-3 1/2 gallons of water. If your sink is not deep enough to cover half the fermenter use any type of container that will work. Pure in wort, straining if necessary. I use mesh bags for hops and moss, so straining is not necessary. The wort will be cooled to around 80-85 degrees by this process. Stir wort to bring the cold water from around the sides about every 5 minutes until wort has cooled to 70 degrees. Then aerate the wort. There are several methods for doing this. I use a pump for fish tanks. They are very cheap and work very well with an aerating stone. Always use an in line filter to make sure you do not get any unwanted germs into the wort. After aerating the wort for approximately 2 hours and pitch yeast. Put in place whatever type of airlock you prefer. I prefer a tube running into a bucket filled with water for primary fermentation. After 7 to 10 days drain wort from primary to secondary fermentor (6 gallon glass carboy). Bottle after 7 to 10 days using 8 oz of honey for priming."

Leaving the leaves (pardon the pun) in the pot, I added the honey. The temp was right about 150F at that point, so I let it sit for a few minutes to pasteurize. I covered the pot, and put it in a sink filled with ice water. About 20 minutes later it had cooled to about 60F, and I transfered it to a 1-gallon jug which had the dregs from a dandelion wine in it. The dandelion wine was the fourth or fifth reculturing of a yeast I've been using for about a year now. It's a mix of Wyeast European Ale yeast and Wyeast Champagne yeast, probably pretty heavy on the Champagne at this point, due to alcohol levels. Possibly contaminated, but a sip of the dandelion wine told no such tale. (Though it was very immature, it didn't taste contaminated.) I topped it off with pre-boiled and partially cooled (could have done better, but it mixed in okay) water. 



2 days later, it still hadn't started, and then I remembered that I had forgotten to aerate it. There was an airlock on the mead, so I wasn't terribly worried. I shook that jug mightily, aerating with vigor. It is now fermenting merrily, about 1 week later. I think this should probably be the last time I use that yeast."

At boil add the hops and boill 55 minutes

At 55 minutes add the honey and lemon juice and return to boil for 5 minutes. add finishing hops if using.

Put 4 litres of pre boiled and chilled water into the primary near the end of the boil. (icy cold is best)

Strain the wort into the primary. When the temp is acceptable pitch the yeast.

Transfer to secondary after 7 days (the trub can produce off flavours). If you dry hop, now is the time.

When the fermentation is complete rack to carboy, add the citric acid and age at least one month (I age 3months) in a cool dark place. 

If you are using grains mash as normal.

When you are taking your OG reading make sure you adjust to your liking by adding preboiled and cooled water to lower or DME and/or honey preboiled and cooled to increase. I have never had to increase the OG.

When you are ready to bottle DO NOT heavily prime. I recomend 55-75g DME to prime. The equivalent in honey (68-95g aprox) will give the braggot even better honey aroma. Remember this is an ale not a lager...should not be overly carbonated. Condition in bottle for 2 days at room temp and then 12 days in your cellar or a cool place. Serve chilled."

During and following mashout, and prior to transferring to the boil kettle, remove a gallon at a time of the first runnings to a pot. Boil until caramellized and return to the mash tun. Continue until 1/4 to 3/8 of the final volume has been caramellized. (Five gallons in the 20 gallon case). Throw the first wort Perle into the boil kettle prior to beginning the sparge. 



Mashing Schedule: 15 minutes 104 F

15 minutes 140 F

45 minutes at 158 F

15 minute mashout at 170 F 



Fermented with starter in carboys. 3 days at 60 F, 3 days at 63 F, 28 days at 66 F (You don't _need_ to leave it this long. I didn't get an opportunity to rack before then...) 



Batch will require rousing. Transfer to secondary will normally be sufficient, but an occasional swirl after transfer will do no harm. Transfer to secondary is HIGHLY recommended due to the incredible amount of sediment from the chocolate powder dropping out of suspension after the most vigorous fermentation has subsided. (Wait until the kraeusen falls before racking.) 



Sub 8.5 # LME, 7.5 DME for pale malt for extract/specialty grain based (5 gallons). Scale everything else down accordingly. IBUs should scale fairly linearly."

- sparged with 4 qts of 170F water

- SG of runnings: 1.036 in ~7 qts

- added LME, made volume up to 3 gal, boiled for 1 hr

- chilled with immersion chiller, aerated, made volume up to 5 gal, aerated some more, pitched 1 qt starter

- fermented at 65 - 68F 



I use a grain bag from Williams Brewing (800-759-6025) that is made to fit inside a bucket type lauter tun. It also fits perfectly inside my 3 gallon SS kettle. 



To do the mash on my stove, I just heat up the mash water to ~165F (in my kettle) then drop in the grain bag containing the crushed grains. Stir real well, let it sit for a minute, then check the temp. If its to low (which it will be) either add small amounts of boiling water (1 cup at a time, stir, let it sit for a minute, then check the temp) or add heat with the stove burner on medium heat while gently stirring constantly. After you hit the mash temp, cover it up and let it sit for 1 hour. At the end of the 1 hour, I lift the grain bag just above the surface of the wort and sparge by pouring the sparge water over the grains gently with a measuring cup. 



As you can see, my mash setup/technique is pretty simple and does'nt require a lot of extra equipment. I'm not trying to get the max possible extraction from the grains, only the flavor/body that was missing before I started doing these partial mashes. 



Since this setup/technique produces wort that is rather cloudy with grain particles, I've often wondered if it will lead to some astringency in the finished beer. Some of the judges comments (see below) lead me to believe that this does happen. Kirk Fleming asked about this in HBD #1968. Does this stovetop mashing sound similar to what you do?"

So I see no real need for boiling anything, which keeps you from setting the pectin in the juice such that it will never clear. I've never once had a problem with wild yeast or bacterial contamination. 



Just pour the fresh cider, thawed concentrate, and yeast nutrient into a sterile primary fermentation bucket, agitate for oxygenation, then pitch yeast according to package directions. Seal and add airlock. Wait til noticeable fermentation stops - usually around a week. The champagne yeast will clean out residual sugar til it's just about at 1.000. 



At that point, siphon off to another container. The cider will be around 8% ABV, but it will be very thin and way too dry. Use more thawed apple juice concentrate to sweeten it up and prime it. I typically use another 5-6 cans. This will give it a good balance of sweetness while preserving the unadulterated apple flavor. No secondary fermentation necessary.



I bottle it immediately and allow it to carbonate at room temperature. Time varies. Easy trick to knowing when it's ready is to bottle at least some of it in one or more sterile recycled plastic soda bottles. When they're as hard as an unopened soda from the store, the whole batch is carbonated and ready to drink. There will be quite a bit of residual sugar, so refrigeration *is* necessary unless you pasteurize it. Three days in the fridge and it will clarify quite nicely. I've not yet ever had any last long enough to worry about lingering fermentation bursting a bottle :)"

Mix the maple syrup or honey with cold water in a large open container to almost 5 gallons at your target specific gravity.

Pitch the dissolved yeast and yeast nutrient, dregs included, into a glass carboy. Then splash in the must and slosh around until well mixed, oxygenated, and full. 



Use a blow off tube for the first few days and then switch to a water trap. After about 60 days, when the maple wine is crystal clear and you can shine a flashlight beam right thru the carboy onto the wall, bottle your maple wine. It is ready to drink immediately. Make some for Christmas! 



I always use yeast nutrient and plenty of yeast for starter, so the fermentation takes off with a bang and the rapidly rising alcohol content quickly kills anything else. For this reason I have never heated the maple syrup or honey, and have had no problems with contamination."

Racked to secondary and dry hopped. Secondary was very slow, and took 3 weeks to stabilize SG. I had heard that Mendocino yeast is not a great attenuator, and also the English DME finishes higher than American, but this is only 69% apparent attenuation. This gives an actual attenuation of 57%. Wow! 



I was originally going to prime with gyle but there were too many variables on this one so I chickened out and primed with corn sugar -- at this point I didn't want to risk screwing up my Christmas beer, and such a great one at that.

- Note #1: My experience is that cider has a SG of 1.040 - 1.055 so the resulting hard cider will be in the 5% abv range. 



- Note #2: Some folks like to kill off the wild yeast with bisulfite before pitching their wine yeast, but I find that this is unnecissary and leads to unplesant residual sulfur taste."

The instructions always say that you don't have to, but since you're using the dry malt instead of dextrose, you need to boil the ingredients. Add the 2 lbs of dry malt SLOWLY, and make sure you break up all of the clumps. It's kind of like adding a hot coco package to hot water. Stir the hell out of it and add the agave nectar. In the last 20 min or so add the orange peel to the mix in a sock or grain bag. Combine with 3 gallons of cold water in your fermenter. All the kits (and Charlie Papazian) say that you should have a specific temp to pitch the yeast, but i've done this at 120 degrees, and even as low as 70...the yeast will start. 



Keep the wort in your primary for a week or until the active fermentation stops, then put it in a secondary fermenter. MINIMIZE TRUB. I was pretty scared, because i left it in the secondary for about 3 weeks, but it actually seemed to work out just fine.



When you're ready to bottle, boil the cup of spray malt and the honey with a cup of water, and add to your nearly finished brew. Bottle accordingly and let carbonate for 5 days to a week. Chill, open, and enjoy the deliciousness!"

This will help break down their cell walls and give their flavors into the beer more easily. While brewing, take the chiles back out of the freezer so they're thawed before you put them in your boiling wort (or you'll just plunge the temp of your wort down way below boiling and lose a bunch of time). Brew beer as normal (why repeat information?) and add the chiles at the last ten minutes of the 60 min boil. If you don't want the beer as spicy, reduce the time the chiles are boiled. Strain hops and chiles (whirpool and rack for most of us, i am sure), chill and pitch your yeast. Recipe says to chill to 66 degrees and then let the temp rise to 68 and hold. Ferment as usual... 5-7 days in primary... 10-ish days in 2nd.... Bottle.

Add 2 teaspoons of gypsum, and stir (gypsum won't completely dissolve). Place malted grains (6-row pale, crystal, dextrine, chocolate, and roasted barley) in a grain bag along with 1 1/4 pounds of oats, and place in the pot. 



Add heat slowly and carefully to raise the temp to 130 degrees. Hold at 130 degrees for 1/2 hour. Add an additional 3 quarts of warm water (approx 130 degrees) to the pot. (8 1/2 quarts total now) Add 2 pounds of diastatic liquid malt extract, stirring thoroughly, and raise temp to 150 degrees. Hold at 150 degrees for an additional 15 minutes. Stir in the additional 2 teaspoons of gypsum into an additional 2 quarts of water (150 degrees) in a separate pot, and then add to the pot. (10 1/2 quarts total water now) Raise the temp to 158 degrees, and hold for 15 minutes. At this point, the extraction process should be complete, so sparge the bags of grain with 1 1/2 gallons of 170 degree water. This brings the total in the pot to 3 3/4 gallons, or 16 1/2 quarts. Remove the pot from the heat and add remaining 2 pounds of diastatic liquid malt extract, and stir well to dissolve. Raise the heat on the pot until a rolling boil is achieved. Add 1 oz bullion hops At 30 minutes into the boil (30 minutes left), add 1 oz willamette hops At 45 minutes into the boil (15 minutes left), add 1/2 oz fuggle hops, and 1/4 teaspoon Irish Moss. Remove any hot break as it develops! At the end of the boil, remove the pot from the stove, and chill with a wort chiller to 110 degrees. Place 1 1/4 gallons (5 quarts) of cold tap water in the 6 gallon primary. Strain wort through previously rinsed grain bag, into the primary, to remove cold break. Check temp to assure that it is near to 72 degrees (not much over 80 degrees). Record temp: Check specific gravity and record: Stir vigorously to incorporate lots of oxygen. Add yeast, and seal with cover and air lock. 



After a week or so (maybe less?), transfer to secondary carboy. Record specific gravity: When final gravity is about 1.011-1.015 (a bit higher than some ales...), or when no fermenting is at all present, it is time to keg and enjoy! Record final gravity: 



It may be OK to do the initial partial mash by just bringing mash temp up to 150 degrees for 1/2 hour, and then adding 2 pounds of diastatic for 1/2 hour, and then just going to full boil. However, it was felt that closely following the suggestion of Charlie Papazian was prudent for the first try. While he may not even get any of this brew, this recipe was developed at the urging of Mike (Mr. Toast) Landry. The goal was somewhere between Mill City's Oatmeal Stout, and Guiness Stout."

Cool, dump in fermenter, aerate well and add yeast. Ferment to completion (usually 3-4 weeks). Boil a mixture of 3 cans frozen concentrate apple juice (do not add water) 1 cup brown sugar and 1/ 2cup honey and potassium sorbate (follow instructions on bottle) Add this to secondary fermenter and siphon finished cider onto it. Taste for sweetness add more sugars if desired. If kegging it can be done now, if bottling i would let it age a month or so. Thats it! The taste greatly improves after 3 monthes but its hard to keep around that long! Enjoy."

The smoker is similar to a grill, but has a higher level for the smoking items and a tray in between the heat source and smoking item, that holds water. The water produces steam that keeps the grain moist throughout the smoking. I cut 1/2"" pieces of wood from 2"" diameter branches, then soak the wood for 20 minutes. The wood pieces ar then placed on top of hot charcoal, which produces smoke very quick. Then the grains are placed on a stainless steel screen on the smoker rack & smoked for about 1 hour. 



(Low on hops for more smoke flavor character). 



Single step Infusion Mash at 154 for 90 minutes.

Warning: This beer disappears very quickly when friends are around. For Extract batches, the smoked & specialty grains can be steeped up to 170 for 45 min.

This should produce a beer in the 1050's for starting gravity."

Keep Fermentation bucket at constant room temperature (maybe using a brew belt). Transfer to secondary fermenter for final clearing stage (4 days for me), keep secondary fermenter in a cold place to aid clearing. If beer wont clear use more finings. Make up sugar solution. I made mine by dissolving 1/2tsp of white plain table sugar per pint (20 tsp) in 1 pint of boiling water, and cooling this by adding 1 pint of cold water to this ( making 2 pints all together). Put this in bottom of 5 gallon Pressurized keg. Rack Beer into keg so it is mixed well with sugar solutution. Leave to carbonate naturally for 4-7 days at room temperature (although i wrapped my keg in a towel for extra warmth). The beer may need force carbonating after a short period depending how well the natural carbonation worked. Drink up !!!!"

PITCH AND FERMENT

Chill the wort down to 65F, Pitch and let self-rise to about 82-83f and hold it there with temp control. The yeast will keep the temp for about 5 days when fermentation is about 80% done (about 1.020). Begin to chill down to 65f until you hit terminal gravity at 1.018 which should take another 2 days.

Hops- Cascade additions at 1/2oz at boil, and at 1 hour. Shoot for 30 IBUs. 

Total Boil time is 1.5 hours. Use liquid Wyeast #1056 and ferment around 69 degrees 



The above is the exact directions that I received from the brewmaster at the brewery. Of course the ingredients were in percentages. I have broken them down to 5 gallon batch amounts above.



The simplified instructions are;



Mash keeping the tempature as close to 157 degrees as possible. I used a RIMS system with a PID tempature controller that kept it within one degree but not everyone has a RIMS. So just do your best to keep it at 157 for 90 minutes.



Add the Cascade hops 1/2 oz when it reaches a boil and another 1/2 oz one hour later. I used pellet hops. If you use whole leaf, you will need to use more. This is not an overly hoppy recipe so be careful and don't over do it. 



Add 1 tsp Irish Moss 15 minutes before the end of the boil. Drop to 69 degrees as quickly as possible after the boil and pitch the yeast. 



Optionally, you can add 3/4 pound of oatmeal flakes to the mash to add some sweetness. The recipe turns out great either way.



I don't bottle, I keg it and charge it with beergass Co2/Nitrogen at 30psi but normal carbonation works great too."

Notes:

The BrewMajic System is not ideal for step mashes as the wort is still viscous at the lower rests and does not perform well in a constant recirculation-which resulted in a stuck mash or two. This was remedied by loosening up the grain bed manually. Once the 73C temperature was reached, the mash tested negative for starch. Whirlfloc tablet added with 15 minutes left of the boil. Compressed oxygen was added to fermenter at 20 psi. Final wort temp was 19C."

Mash for 10 minutes at 113 degrees F, 10 minutes at 122 F, 60 minutes at 149 F, and 10 minutes at 168 F. Boil for 90 minutes.



Fermentation: Make 1 liter of starter wort and aerate it on a stir plate. Add oxygen in-line as the wort was transferred from the chiller to the carboy. Pitch yeast at 58 F. Allow fermentation to rise to 62 F for the first three days. Raise temperature to 65 F for four more days. Then raise to 68 F to clean up any off flavors. Drop temperature to 34 F for three days to crash yeast, proteins, and tannins. Keg and carbonate to 4 volumes CO2.



This is a very simple recipe that relies on fermentation-derived flavors and proper mouth feel to achieve the best result. The step mash procedure I used was developed via trial and error over a number of batches. The ferulic acid rest increases the clove character of the beer, while the protein and the low saccharification-rest temp creates a highly fermentable wort with a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonating to 3.5 to 4 volumes is necessary for this beer to be true to style and enhances the mouthfeel and refreshing nature of the beer."

Mash for 60 minutes at 151 degrees F and mash out for 10 minutes at 168 F. Boil for 60 minutes. When yeasting, use a rocked carboy for about 5 minutes to oxygenate. Add 3 vials of yeast (no starter).



Fermentation: Primary fermentation for three weeks at 68 F. Cold-crash for two days. Rack to secondary and dry-hop/dry-habañero with 1 ounce Citra, 1 ounce Cascade, and 1 habañero chili pepper (pith, seeds, and all) for seven days. Cold-crash again for two days; rack to keg and force-carbonate.

Water profile: NYC tap water and added 2 teaspoons gypsum (calcium sulfate) to mash.



A solid malt backbone plus firm bitterness plus fresh American citrus/tropical hops plus habañero chili pepper flavor/heat. Dry hopping with the habañero didn't quite give me enough flavor or heat, which is why I added a measured amount of the infused vodka as well. However, it's important to taste the beer after secondary and while adding the vodka to make sure you don't overdo the heat. This beer goes great with BBQ or Mexican food."

2. Pour approximately 2 gallons (7.6 L) dechlorinated water into your boiling kettle. Bring water to 150–160 °F (66–71 °C). Place specialty grains in steeping sock and place sock in water. Allow grains to steep for 20 minutes at 150–160 °F (66–71 °C). Stir well repeatedly throughout the 20 minutes to allow for maximum color, flavor and aroma extraction. After 20 minutes remove grains and bring water to a boil.



3. Turn off heat. Add malt syrup, dry malt extract and bittering hops. Stir well so that ingredients do not stick to the bottom of kettle. Hops may be put directly into kettle, straining bag not required.



4. Bring wort back up to a boil (watch for possible boil over). Allow to boil for 45 minutes. Control heat during boil so boil-over does not occur. 15 minutes before the end of the 45-minute boil add Irish moss (or Whirlfloc tablet) into the boiling wort. Two minutes before the end of the 45-minute boil, add aroma.



5. After 45 minute boil, turn off heat. If possible, place boiling pot into a sink of cold water. Circulate cold water around the outside of the pot for 15–20 minutes. Cool the wort to 110–120 °F (43–49 °C). Pour or siphon wort from boiling kettle to primary fermenter (attempt to leave most of the hop residue and any proteins behind. Add enough cold water (refrigerated with no chlorine) to the wort and bring the volume up to 5 gallons (19 L).



6. Check temperature of wort and obtain 60–75 °F (16–24 °C). If necessary, place primary fermenter into a sink of cold water to achieve this temperature range.



7. Add yeast. If using liquid yeast make sure it has previously been incubated or have yeast starter ready. If dry yeast is being used, rehydrate according to manufacturer’s instructions or sprinkle on top of wort. Check starting specific gravity with hydrometer. Fill airlock half full with water and attach to primary fermenter lid. Fermentation will commence within 24 to 72 hours.



8. When airlock stops bubbling (only bubbles 1 time per minute) check specific gravity. If doing a one-stage fermentation go to step 10.



9. Recommended step: Siphon beer off yeast sediment into a 5-gallon glass carboy. Do not splash. Allow beer to sit in carboy until clear, usually 5-7 days. Add a fining agent if desired.



10. Sanitize bottles. Siphon beer from primary or secondary fermenter into priming container. Dissolve 3/4 cup priming sugar in 1 cup boiling water. Add this sugar mixture to the beer in the priming container. Stir well but do not splash.



11. Fill bottles to within one inch of the top. Cap bottles and allow to sit at 60-75 °F (16-24 °C) for two weeks. The bottles may then be refrigerated. The beer may be consumed after two weeks but will continue to improve up to 2 months in the bottle. The beer will store well for a year or longer. Chill the beer to 45-55 °F (7-13 °C) and enjoy!"

Adding the lactic acid rather than biologically souring the beer is definitely a shortcut, and one that adds time to the processing, as it takes longer after bottling for the flavors to ""marry"" than for conditioning to develop. If you have a lactobacillus culture in your possession that will do the job, have at it."

Stir in chocolate and black patent malts (UNCRUSHED!) and boil 15 min. Stir in 1/2 oz. Perle hops and boil 15 min. Add Hallertauer hops in the last minute of the boil. Strain though a nylon meshed colander into Primary fermentor. Top up to 5 gallons with cold water. Cool wort as fast as possible. (I cooled it to 80 degrees in 9 minutes.) At 80F add yeast. Ferment for 12 days at 40-48 degrees. Rack it into the secondary and let it sit and ferment VERY slowly for 1 month at 32-40 degrees. Bottle and let age for a full month at 34 degrees."

2. Pour 2 gallons (7.6 L) of clean water into a 4-gallon (15.2 L) or larger pot. Put all crushed grains into a steeping bag and tie the end into a knot to close it. Place the grain filled bag into the brew pot water and heat to approximately 160–170 °F (71–77 °C). Do not boil the grains. Carefully remove the grain bag and allow it to drain into the brew pot without squeezing. Discard the grain-filled bag.



3. Heat the brew pot water to boiling. Remove kettle from heat. Add malt extract syrup and dry malt extract. Stir well and return to heat. Stir constantly until it returns to a boil. Add bittering hops. Be careful not to let the pot boil over. Do not use the kettle lid. Boil for 55 minutes, stirring occasionally, and then add finishing hops. Boil for an additional 5 minutes (total boiling time is 60 minutes).



4. Cool the wort rapidly to 70 °F (21 °C). Pour the brew pot contents into a sanitized 6.5-gallon (24.7-L) fermenter. Adhering a liquid crystal thermometer to the outside of the fermenter can monitor temperature.



5. With the cooled wort in the fermenter, add cold water (70 °F/21 °C) until the level reaches the 5-gallon (19-L) mark on the bucket. Sanitize a hydrometer and take the original gravity (OG) reading. Be sure to record this number for future reference.



6. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the wort and stir well. Insert the sanitized airlock into the sanitized lid. Secure the lid on the fermenter with the airlock in place (approximately half filled with clean water).



7. Place the fermenter in a warm area to maintain a temperature of 68–72 °F (20–22 °C). Keep the fermenter away from sunlight and fluorescent lights. You should notice bubbling in the airlock within 24 hours. Bubbling will slow down significantly after one or two days and then stop completely after 7–10 days. When bubbling has stopped completely prepare for bottling or optional secondary fermentation.

*Optional — a process called secondary (or two-stage) fermentation may be used to improve beer clarity and to remove sediment. After primary fermentation completes, siphon the beer into a 5-gallon (19-L) glass carboy, attach the airlock via a rubber stopper and let set for 6-7 days or until clear.



8. Sanitize all equipment used for bottling and kegging and get your beer into its final container."

If you are using a liquid yeast, make a starter 24 to 48 hours in advance.



1) Steep grains in 2.5 gal of water for 20 minutes in 170 degree water. Remove bag and discard.



2) Bring water to full boil and stir in 3 lbs Amber DME and 1 lb Wheat DME.



3) Add 1 oz Willamette hops and boil for 60 min



4) 15 min before end of boil, add 3.15 lbs of Dark Malt Syrup



5) At the end of the boil, add in 30 mL of bacon extract



6) Cool wort, add to fermenter, add water to bring level to 5 gal of liquid, aerate, and add yeast



7) Let sit for 14 days and rack to secondary



8) Add maple syrup in at secondary as to not stress the yeast, and so that most of the flavor does not come out during the fermentation. 



9) This step is optional. Cook 1 to 2 lbs of smoked bacon. Put the fat/grease and a few bacon pieces into a container with 1 cup of alcohol (use scotch or vodka). Let sit throughout primary and secondary fermentation. 2 or 3 days before bottling, remove bacon pieces, allow fat to settle on top of alcohol, and place in freezer. Remove as much of the fat and grease as possible from on top of the alcohol and use a coffee filter to strain the remaining fat from the alcohol. Add the bacon infused alcohol into the bottling bucket on bottling day. This will raise the alcohol content and give more bacon flavor to the final product. 



10) After 7 days in secondary, add 5 oz priming sugar and bottle or keg



Note - Let the brew age in the bottle or keg for 1 to 2 months for optimal taste"

3. After sprout cook them at a very low temp no more than 130 until brown. 

4. After finished sprouting crack the grains. I use my grain mill.



Sweet Potato Prep:

1. Wash and keep skins on. 

2. Grill until burnt.

3. Put them in a food processor and mash it. 

Tea Prep:

1. Boil 4 oz Black Roasted Chestnut tea for exactly 9 min in 1.5 gallons of water. 



Mash sweet potato and buckwheat in separate bags with the tea and place in water at 165 degrees for 60 min.



Bring wort to boil, and primary fermentable sugars, return to boil and achieve hot break.

Heat 3 gallons of ABQ tap water to 130 deg in the brewing kettle (NOTE: Should have added 3.5 gallons)



Add the 12 lb of grain to brewing kettle and allow temp to stabilize to 122 deg F

Hold for 30 mins at 122 deg f

Heat 1.5 gallons of water to boiling

Pop Wyeast packet



After 30 mins is up, add the 1.5 gallons of boiling water to the kettle and allow to stabilize to 148 to 152 deg F

Hold for 60 mins at 148 to 152

Begin heating 5 gallons of sparge water

Mash out at 165 after the 60 mins of 148 to 152



Sparge: With 5 gallons of water at 170 (we are using a square sparge arm)



Boil: After sparge is complete do a 60 minute boil - (Make sure that you have about 7 gallons of wart to boil, if not add water to the wart until you have 7 gallons you will loose anywhere from 1.75 to about 2 gallons to the boil depending on climate)



Add boiling hops 30 mins into the boil using hop sock (2 oz Columbus & 1 oz Nugget)



Add flameout hops when the flame goes off the boil (1 oz Columbus & 1 oz Nugget)



Cool: Cool in kettle using copper cooling coil to 70 deg F 

While cooling sanitize everything you will use from this point on (fermentation lock, carboy, any tubing/hoses used, thermometer, yeast packet, etc)



When cooled to 70 degrees transfer using sterilized hoses into a sterilized 6 gallon carboy make sure to take enough wart out to obtain the OG (NOTE: at this point we added more water because our yield was low-however this should have been noticed at the beginning of the boil and added then)



Add yeast, agitate, and affix fermentation lock



Primary Fermentation: 7 days at about 65 deg 



Secondary Fermentation: transfer to secondary fermenter, add aroma hops in steril hop sock, and ferment for 7 days 



Keg: Transfer into sterilized, CO2 filled keg force carbonate to desired CO2 content"

Remove from heat. Stir in 12 lbs. honey. Return to heat. Bring to a boil then immediately reduce heat to a light simmer. Scum will form (white to light tan). Skim it off till it stops showing up (10 min. to and hour and a half. Depends on the honey). If the scum forming is dark tan or brown, turn the heat down fast. Remove from heat and immediately add the concord grape concentrate. Cover and let sit for 15 min. This pasteurizes the juice, but is not hot enough to set the pectin (not much pectin in the grape juice, it's mostly in the skins). Fill your carboy with a little less than 1 gal. of cold water. Add the must to the carboy. Add yeast nutrient and energizer. Put an airlock on the carboy. Do not agitate it at this stage. When the temperature is down to 70-80 deg. F pitch the yeast. Let it sit for a day. Then use the shaker method to up the yeast count (more on this in a moment). 



When fermentation tapers off, feed it. Treat the extra 3 lbs. the same way you do the first 12 lbs. You will need about 1/2-2/3 gal. of water. Add this to the fermenter (did I mention that I use 7.5 gal. carboys for 5 gal. batches?) If you have to, remove some of the pyment from the fermenter and store it in a 1 gal. bottle (with an airlock). You can then add this 1 gal. back into the main batch at bottling time. 



The Shaker Method: 



When making mead, pitch a large quantity of yeast (liquid cultures are preferred, they tend to be a lot healthier than powdered yeasts). Use yeast energizer and yeast nutrient in the amounts listed on the packages. The next day, shake the carboy hard for one or two minutes. Repeat this shaking every day till you start to get out-gassing from the mead. At this point STOP. If you don't, you will end up with mead flavored ceiling. This shaking method is used in mycology labs to grow production quantities of many yeasts. It tends to accelerate growth by a factor of ten or more (depending on the yeast strain and growth media in use). 



If you don't use yeast nutrient and energizer, expect initial fermentation to take several months (assuming 65-75 deg. F ambient temperature). With this method, you can cut initial fermentation (primary fermentation if you like) down to a few weeks to a month. This method does not affect the flavor of the mead at all. I have done several side by side comparisons. Some boiled, some not boiled. Some with energizer and/or nutrient, some without. Some with shaking, some without. And combinations of all of these. No change in flavor or aroma was found."

Begin by measuring the proper quantity of mash water into your mashing or boil kettle. Be sure that the water has no chlorine. Bring water temperature of mash water to strike water temperature. 



2. Make sure grains are milled. Pour grains into mash kettle at strike temperature. Stir well. 



3. Allow grains to “stew” at 152 °F 

(67 °C) for 60 minutes. Stir the mash every 15 minutes or so to ensure even temperature throughout the mash.



4. Fill the 20-quart (~20-L) kettle with 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water. Bring this water to 170 °F (77 C). Maintain this temperature throughout the mashing process to allow for easy sparging.



5. Optional step: Raise the mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C). This step is called a mash out. Hold the mash temperature at 168 °F (76 °C) for 5 minutes. This helps to stabilize enzyme activity and warms the sugars so that they can be extracted more efficiently. The temperature of the mash can be raised to 168 °F (76 °C) by adding heat to the bottom of the mashing vessel or by infusing the mash with small quantities of boiling water.



6. Transfer the mash into lauter tun. Open valve on lauter tun and collect first runnings into a pitcher. Slowly pour first running over top of grain bed and allow to drain back through grain bed. Continue recirculation of first runnings until clarity improves.



7. Once clarity improves, begin collecting runnings into boil kettle or other container. The sparging process should take approximately 45–60 minutes. Restrict the flow of the wort exiting the lauter tun so that run off takes 45–60 minutes. Begin pouring 170 °F (77 °C) sparge water over the top of the grain bed one pitcher at a time. Try not to allow grain bed to run dry or compaction of grain bed could occur.



8. Continue sparging until 6.5 gallons (24.7) of wort is collected. Bring 6.5 gallons of wort to a boil. Allow wort to boil for 30 minutes before adding bittering hops. Add the bittering hops 60 minutes before the end of the 90-minute boil. Add flavoring hops 15 minutes before the end of the 90-minute boil. If you are using an immersible wort chiller, place it in the boiling wort with the flavor hops. Irish moss (whirlfloc tablet) should also be added 15 minutes before end of boil. If you have aroma hops, add them 2 minutes before the end of the 90 minute boil. Add bittering hops 60 minutes before end of boil. Add Irish moss and flavoring hops 15 minutes before end of boil (and your immersion chiller if you are using one). Add aroma hops 2 minutes before end of boil.



9. After the boil, cool wort to 60–75 °F (16–24 °C). Siphon or pour wort into primary fermenter. Attempt to leave any trub behind. If you have less than 5 gallons (19 L) of wort in fermenter, cool, clean dechlorinated water may be added to increase volume. 



10. Add yeast and ferment between 60 and 75 °F (16–24 °C).



11. When fermentation completes, sanitize all bottling equipment and bottle or keg as desired."

It is not a difficult recipe but it is time consuming to do properly. First, we're after an OG of 1.104 and an ABV of 11.03%. Here we go!



Bring 6.5 gallons of water just to a boil and dissolve in 1 Tbsp of Five Star 5.2 Ph stabilizer. Preheat your mash tun with 1 gallon of boiling water and drain it after 10 minutes. Always add grain to water, not the reverse. Calculate the grain temp and volume for a mash conversion at 148F. The strike temp will likely be in the range of 160F-168F, (but you must calculate this exactly). Convert for 60 minutes at 148F. Now calculate a second step infusion temp for at 152F by adding 1.75 gallons for 30 minutes. Drain 6.0 - 6.25 gallons of wort. Your OG at this stage will be about 1.080 - 1.085. Remove 2 gallons to a smaller stainless pot and gently boil-off 33% of the volume leaving 1.33 gallons. This will caramelize the wort as wll as increase the OG. Pour the 1.33 gallons of caramelized wort back into the main boil. 



This will be a 60 minute boil. Bring main wort pot to a boil. After first heat break add 2 oz fresh Nugget hops to a hops bag and boil for 60 minutes. At the last 20 minutes of the boil add Irish Moss. At the last 7 minutes add the Cascade hops, (in a hops bag). At boils end remove hops and squeeze wort as much as possible with a sterile spoon/spatula. You should have approximately 4.25 gallons of high gravity wort, (very close to 1.104). Cool wort quickly down to 65F-70F via coil or chill plate. Oxygenate wort well for 60-90 seconds using an oxygen kit and wand. Now comes a very important part unlike many fermentation methods. Do not pitch yeast. You will pitch the 4.25 gallons onto a yeast cake of US-05 of a previous fermentation or prepared culture not more than 7 days old. US-05 will complement the Barleywine's character and final gravity. After 5 days oxygenate again and make a prepared cream of one packet (11 grams), of Nottingham yeast and pitch again. Let ferment in primary for 9 additional days then decant to glass or stainless for secondary fermentation for 6 weeks. 



Priming to bottles required additional considerations. First, bottling will require less priming sugar. Use about half what you normally use, (22g DME/gal or 12g Dextrose/gal). Also, when preparing the priming sugar, cool to 75F and add 15-20 grams, (2-3 Tbsp), of live krausening yeast from your fermentation bucket. Slurry well the priming solution then decant from your secondary onto this slurry in the bottling bucket. Fill bottle to 1"" inch from the top on long-necks and cap with oxygen absorbing caps. 



This Barleywine is best after 12 months of bottled fermentation. It is creamy with a very subtle fruit finish and a rich, satisfying mouth-feel. The hops are perfectly balanced with the first run barley richness. I brew this twice yearly with great anticipation each time. It will yield only 4 cases so brew often and let me know if you have found a way to improve it."

I brewed this, and after 3 wks in the bottle is it quite good. I currently have a Panel of Expert reviewing it, and when he tries it, we'll know more on how to tweek the recipe. Right now, I would say be careful of the Black Patent, and cut back on the Dextrin Malt to maybe a quarter pound. I think it has a bit too much of a sweet aftertaste. The Front-taste is fine, as is the Hop balance, though next time I want to pull back a couple of tablespoons of the Black Patent for my taste. 



For you extract brewers, I would say to use 6-7 lbs of Pale Extract and use all of the specialty grains."

Sparge water temperature 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.8 degrees Celsius) 



Triple Decoction method used:



Bring water up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit stir in grains for 5 minutes, and then let rest for 30 minutes. Remove grains (heavy mash) getting out as much water as possible. It should be noted the left over water is called the thin mash. Stir while bringing heavy mash up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit stir for 5 minutes at temperature, let rest for 5 minutes, and then bring to a boil stirring the heavy mash the whole time. String grains at a boil for 15 minutes remove from heat then add back into thin mash. Add slowly do not go over 122 degrees Fahrenheit, may have to stop and let thin mash cool, before adding more heavy mash. Once all the heavy mash has been added into the thin mash and temperature is between 119 and 122 degrees Fahrenheit let rest for 30 minutes. Remove heavy mash, and stir while bringing heavy mash up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit stir for 5 minutes at temperature, let rest for 5 minutes, and then bring to a boil stirring the heavy mash the whole time. String grains at a boil for 15 minutes remove from heat then add back into thin mash. Remove from heat and slowly add back into thin mash to not go over 145 degrees Fahrenheit, may have to stop and let thin mash cool while adding the heavy mash back in. Once all the heavy mash is back in and the temp is between 140 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit let rest for 30 minutes. Remove heavy mash, stir while bringing heavy mash up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit stir for 5 minutes at temperature, let rest for 5 minutes, and then bring to a boil stirring the heavy mash the whole time. String grains at a boil for 15 minutes remove from heat then add back into thin mash. Remove from heat and add back into the thin mash do not go over 158 degrees Fahrenheit, once all of the heavy mash has been added back into the thin mash and the tempura is between 153 and 158 degrees Fahrenheit let rest for 30 minutes. This time remove the thin mash and bring it to a boil, kill the heat when thin mash starts to boil then remove from heat and add back into the heavy mash do not go over 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Once all the thin mash has been added back into the heavy mash let rest for 30 minutes. 



Boil:



90 minute boil. Add hops 30 minutes into the boil. Add Irish Moss during last 15 minutes of boil. Stir in Honey after the boil when the mort has cooled to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) to maintain the honey's properties. Sprinkle the yeast in minimum 10 times its weight of sterile water or wort at 23°C ± 3°C (73°F ± 6°F). Leave to rest 15 to 30 minutes. Gently stir for 30 minutes, and pitch the resultant cream into the fermentation vessel 



Fermentation:



Ferment for 8 weeks in the primary,(38 degrees Fahrenheit) before racking, pull it out of the fridge and let it warm to 45 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 days (dialectal rest). Rack it, and leave it around 38 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 weeks. Keg it, force carbonate, and keep between 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. After 3 months it is ready to drink, This braggot tastes strange when it is green. It really needs the extra time to settle down."

(150-155 degrees F is the preferred temperature range). Heat in a second pot 2.0 gallons of water to 170 degrees F. After 30 minutes at 150-155 degrees F, pour the grain mash through a strainer into the brewpot and sparge grains with 2.0 gallons of 170 degrees F water. Add 1 tsp. Gypsum to boiling pot. Turn the heat to high, add 3 more gallons of heated water to the brewpot and bring the liquor to a boil. Remove the pot from the burner and add 1.0 lb. of dry malt extract. Return to burner to get to a boil, dissolve the malt extract and add 0.9 oz. of Magnum hops. Boil for 60 minutes total duration. With 30 minutes to go in the boil, add 1.0 oz. Amarillo hops. With 20 minutes to go in the boil add 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss. With 15 minutes to go in the boil, add 1.0 oz. of Cascade hops. Clean and assemble the Wort Chiller and place into the hot wort to sanitize it. With 1 minute to go in the boil, add 1.0 oz. Cascade hops. At flameout, add the liquid malt extract and stir well to mix, wait 10 minutes to sanitize. Make sure the wort temperature stays above 165 degrees F while the malt extract is dissolving. When all the extract is dissolved and sanitized, connect the hose to the Wort Chiller inlet, turn on the water faucet to pass cold water through the hose and cool the wort. Rehydrate the 2 packets of Safale-05 dry yeast in 12 oz of 90 degrees F preboiled water about 15 minutes before pitching. Cover measuring cup with Saran wrap. When the wort is cooled, transfer and strain the wort into the sanitized carboy, then top off to the 5.0 gallon mark as needed with additional cold (preboiled) water. Seal the fermenter with a sanitized stopper. Mix the wort well and take the O.G. measurement and wort temperature and record.



Open fermenter and pitch (pour) the rehydrated yeast solution when wort is cooled to under 74 degrees F. Stopper and mix well again. Open the fermenter and put the sanitized aeration stone in the wort and aerate the wort and yeast for 30 minutes minimum. Remove the aeration stone. Apply sanitized stopper with fermentation lock. Fill fermentation lock partially with water. Ferment at 66-68 degrees F in a closet. Bubbling should start within 24 hours. Sanitize a second carboy and siphon to prepare for transferring the wort to a secondary fermenter. Transfer wort to a secondary fermenter after one week or when the primary fermentation is complete. After siphoning all the wort, place the sanitized fermentation lock on the fermenter and partially fill the lock with water. Record temperature and final volume of beer for secondary fermentation. Hold secondary fermenter at 66-68 degrees F in the dark closet. After one week or when the secondary fermentation is done, clean and sanitize 5 gallon corny keg. Sanitize siphon, carboy, spoon, beer thief, hydrometer and thermometer. After secondary fermentation is done, take the Final Gravity measurement, wort temperature and record. Siphon beer into the corny keg, close keg and maintain at room temperature for one week. Alternatively force carbonate with 15 lbs. CO2 pressure and store in the refrigerator."

1:15 alpha-amylase rest





Take first runnings (drain all liquid from mash tun without adding any further sparge water(*)) to get about 4-4.5 gallons @ 1.080. Boiling down to 3 gallons will give an OG of 1.105 - 1.120.

Rack into secondary and add 1 oz of EKG plugs for dry hopping.

Top up kettle to 6-6 1/2 gallons for full length boil. 



Bring the wort to a boil along with the Fuggles hops and 3/4 ounce (21 g) of the E.K. Goldings hops. Boil 1 1/2 hours, adding the cane sugar during the boil. Add the balance of the hops for the last 15 minutes of the boil. If you use Irish moss, add 1 1/2 tsp. for the last 20 minutes of the boil. 



Force chill the wort, rack it off of the trub into the fermenter being sure to aerate well, pitch the yeast starter and ferment to completion. Estimated FG of 1014. 



Make up the dark brown sugar with a pint of water for priming, and bottle the brew. Sample after two weeks. 



Malt Extract Recipe: 



Substitute 5 pounds (2270 g) of amber dry malt extract (not Laaglander's, too dextrinous) for the pale malt. No grains are needed. Bring 2 gallons (8 litres) of brewing water to a full boil. As soon as the water boils, remove it from the heat and add sugar and DME. Stir until they are completely dissolved. Only then can you return the wort to the heat, add the hops as above, and return to a boil. Boil 1 hour, adding the last batch of hop pellets for the final 15 minutes. Again, Irish moss is optional. 



Force chill and make up to the full 5 gallons (19 litres) with brewing water, aerate well and follow the directions for all grain for fermentation and bottling."

Added extracts and sugar and brought to boil. Added the ginger, licorice, chocolate, and hops after boil started. I was afraid that the chocolate would burn on the bottom of the boiler, so I set each 1 oz piece on my stiring spoon and dipped gently in the wort until they melted. 



The real interesting thing about the brew was that after pitching, a thick bubbly layer of stuff formed on the surface of the beer in the carboy almost immediately after fermentation started, and never left, even after I expected the Kraeusen to fall. There was the usual amount of activity in the beer, but never more than an inch of Kraeusen. 



The good thing was that after racking to my secondary carboy, I left most of the stuff that was sitting on the surface in my primary, and almost all of the rest in my secondary when I racked to my bottling bucket. 



I primed with amber DME, and the results even after only two weeks are wonderful, however there is still a small layer of this sediment even in the bottle at the surface of the beer."

I throw the berries on top of the wort in primary,and let the primary go until they have leeched all their color out. At that point, I rack to secondary and let it all settle (use finings if you feel the need, I didn't). By the time it's done, you have a beautiful red brew that is then kegged, conditioned, and aged for 3 months in the fridge. If you sterilised the berries right, there's not a trace of haze or cloudiness. It's almost like a raspberry champagne, and a great dessert beer. The initial taste is beery, and then a lingering fruity aftertaste. I used the pilsner kit for its relatively low hop content, allowing the fruitiness to come out a little more. 



(*) Sterilising the berries Because the berries are susceptible to wild yeast on the canes, it is advisable to sterilise the berries by heating them in water to a point a little below 85 degrees centigrade. (adding some dextrose to the water will start leeching out the flavor and color). Any higer, and you will release some pectin into the solution, which will cloud the beer (not critical, it just doens't look as cool as it does when it's crystal clear and bubbling)."

The raspberries were frozen to help break down the cell walls, and they were crushed by hand (in plastic bags) while thawing. The lemon and orange juice were to provide acids. The tea was to provide tannins. I do not know what the nutrient is, but I suspect that it supplied nitrogen. 



Boil the honey in some water for 30 minutes, skimming off any scum, wax, bee parts, etc. that rise to the surface. Remove from heat and add berries, tea, juice, and nutrient. Let sit, covered, for a few minutes to let the heat sanitize the fruit. Chill to room temperature in an icewater bath. Put into primary fermenter and add water to bring the volume of the must up to the appropriate level. Pitch yeast into must. ( I just pour the liquid yeast into the must without making a starter.) It was fermented at about 70 degrees F. (room temperature in my kitchen). 



A word of advice learned from previous experiences: If you use a carboy as your primary frementer, use one with a LOT of extra headspace, or use a wide blow-off tube. If you do not, the raspberry pulp will foam up and will plug the airlock. This will cause a pressure buildup which can pop the stopper off of the carboy and spray your walls with sticky raspberry stuff. I hear that it can also cause your carboy to explode, leaving an even bigger mess. 



Rack after about three weeks, when the fruit pulp has settled. Rack again at month 2, 4, and 6. Bottle at month 8. The mead had cleared and was finished fermenting by the racking at month six. During the last two months in the fermenter there was no airlock activity at all, and nothing more settled out. I waited the extra two months to be certain that the fermentation was complete. There is still some residual sugar, and I did not want the mead to continue fermenting in the bottles."

For the other, I deliberately let the beer fall from the neck of the carboy to the bottom to get some aeration. The second batch (with aeration) had a ""rounder"", more pleasant (IMHO) flavor, with a nice hint of butterscotch (diacetyl)."

Boil the rice in 4 gallons of water for 30 minutes. 3 was not enough and some burned on. (1.5 gal. for 5 gallons). 



Let it cool to 130 degrees, and add the rest of the grain. Leave at this temp for 45 minutes. 



Add boiling water to raise the temp for 158, and mash for another 45 minutes. 



Miscellaneous notes: 1) i've used ale yeast, probably german ale, but that probably won't impress you.

2) *if* you can keep tighht control over the temp during fermentation, you might want to switch to pilsner/st. louis lager yeast. The munich lager yeast, however, is tolerant of temperature fluctuations.

3) I would not substitute a different kind of hops unless you *really* know what you're doing. I ruined a batch of the corn ale (below) by using fuggles; on a beer this light, fuggles gave a taste i thought resembled infection.

4) my notes show initial gravity of 1.040, and final of 1.004. I assume the final meant 1.014, or maybe a broken hydrometer.

5) it's been a while, but it seems to me that i avoided the vitamin-enriched rice. Which is nice, since the base stuff costs about half as much.

6) the rice gives a certain ""crispnesss"" to the taste, which is identifiable as the flavor difference between Budweisser (which uses rice) and other basic american swill (which use corn).

7) i was actually taking mugs of this rather than the stout on the next tap during the vegas summers. Though the first few times i looked to make sure Marlys wouldn't catch me..

8) i don't knwo what athe lovibund (sp?) is on the light crystal; it came from The Home Brewery as ""light crystal"""

Bring 2 gallons water to about 152 degrees Fahrenheit (ideally, 145 degrees minimum and 155 degrees maximum) 

2) Steep grain inside a sackcloth in water at 152 degrees for 50 min. Press and mash grain bag periodically with sterile spoon to ensure maximum extraction. Remove grainbag after 50 min and squeeze the water out and into your kettle.

3) Bring water to a rapid boil and remove from heat. Add dried malt extract and stir in, followed by liquid malt extract. Return to a boil.

4) Add Tradition hops at 10 min.

5) Add Hersbrucker hops at 35 min.

6) Add Citra hops at 50 min.

7) Turn off heat at 50 min. and add honey (stir in), basil, and lemon peel. Let steep for 10 minutes, then strain into another pot (unless you were wise enough to place the basil and lemon peel in a sackcloth! recommended...). You may want to stir in the honey earlier, at about 40 min, to produce more fermentable sugars. However, like hop oils, the longer it is in the boiling water, the more its subtle flavors are removed.

7) Cool. Either use an immersion wort chiller and then add to fermenter with remaining 3.5 gallons water, or chill kettle of wort in an ice bath and then add to fermenter with pre-chilled water (pre-chilling really helps if you don't have a wort chiller). 

8) When wort is at around 70 to 75 degrees, shake fermenter VIGOROUSLY to aerate wort and then pitch yeast (I have pitched at 80 degrees and outcome was still excellent). 

9) Ferment for TWO weeks, then bottle or keg as usual. If you bottle it, age it at least two weeks and then place in refrigerator for one week. Open it on a really hot day (or any day) and enjoy!



Notes: This beer will start off with a vigorous ferment as usual, but will then slow down significantly (not necessarily unusual for Belgian yeasts). It will bubble for almost two full weeks, though. You may or may not wish to use a secondary fermenter; I didn't, and I don't think I ever would because I'm afraid of the risk of oxidizing this beer during its later slow and fragile fermenting period (that's just me, though). If you poured your wort through a strainer and/or used sackcloths, you really won't need a secondary fermenter, either, because there won't be any trub to impart off flavors and the yeast doesn't adversely affect the flavor even after two weeks. As far as yeast sediment goes- just make sure you leave the sediment on the bottom of the fermenter when siphoning to your bottling bucket. Then, leave the last half inch or so of beer in the bottom of your bottling bucket. If you do this, you will have eliminated 99% of the sediment from 5 gallons of beer. And relax, this beer is actually really easy... whatever you do is gonna taste great."

After thirty minutes of stir-well-every-10-minutes (by the way, I use a pair of 40 quart cooler chests for mashing) add boiling water gradually (usually takes 2 gallons) to raise temperature to 155 degrees. Do this in stages...add a quart or two, stir well, stick in your thermometer, give it 5, read, add, repeat. It takes a while to equilibrate temperatures in the porridge, and you can easily bring your mash to 170 degrees (a no no) if you add too fast. Let this sit with periodic stirring for a few hours until converted. Sparge with 11 gallons of water. Collect up all that good stuff (I sparge off between 11 and 13 gallons depending on how long I want to drink while boiling) and boil roil troil and trouble. About 30 minutes before you finally tire of boiling, add 5 ozs. Fuggles leaf hops. Rejoice in the aroma! Turn off the boil. Caper briefly. Add 2 oz. Hallertauer leaf hops. Cover. Cool. Pour into fermenting vessel, pitch yeast (the cake(s) from your last brew, recently stripped of their beery covering. Or be conventional, and use Whitbread Ale from the packet).

FERMENTATION

Chill wort to 65F. Pitch yeast starter. Let rise to 83F over 5 days and bottom heat until gravity is 1.018, (can be up to 2 weeks). Agitate if necessary to invigorate yeast. Decant to glass secondary. Let ferment for 2 more weeks in glass at 65-70F. Move to cooler rack location and let ferment 8 more weeks.



BOTTLING

Create a fresh stir-plate 2 liter yeast pitch using high quality Pils wort. Decant to 500ml. Boil 152 grams dextrose with 1 pint water. Cool and add to bottling fermenter. Decant ale to bottling fermenter and pitch yeast. Stir well then stir well again :) Bottle leaving 1 inch from top of long neck. Let prime for 3 weeks at 78-80F. Move to cellar temps and let chill for 6 months at 55-60F. Drink after 6 months to 1 year.



[EDIT]

Adding 2 liters of yeast is clearly incorrect. We couldn't contact the author of the recipe so here is the recommended yeast from another site."

After 50 minutes of the boil put in the honey. Stir while you pour to prevent burning honey and having it stick on the pot. You won't like the taste very much if it burns. After the 60 minutes is over take the pot off the heat and throw in the ounce of Amarillo hops. You don't boil these because you don't want any of their bittering qualities in this particular beer. You can boil them if you like hoppy beer but I chose to accentuate the clean honey taste rather than the hoppy overtone. It's up to you.

If not, make sure you finely grind the sweet orange peel.

ALSO, do NOT use anything but SWEET orange peel. The other varieties are bitter, and will NOT compliment the taste of this beer.



BREWING THE WORT:



Heat 3 GALLONS of water to 155 DEGREES. If you don't have a thermometer, just boil room temperature water on your stove, on at full heat, for @ 20 minutes (hot water takes @ 10 min.). TURN HEAT OFF.



Place the milled grain - Red Wheat, the Honey Malt, and the Sweet Orange Peel - into a grain bag. SOAK IN HOT WATER FOR 15MINUTES (make sure you have the HEAT TURNED OFF or it can burn the grain, altering the final taste).



After 15 minutes, squeeze out as much of the grain ""milk"" as you can, and discard the grain.



TURN HEAT BACK ON and bring back to 155 DEGREES (or @ another 10 minutes).



TURN HEAT OFF and ADD LIQUID MALT EXTRACT. Make sure the heat is off, or it can burn the malt, altering the beer's final taste. STIR UNTIL COMPLETELY DISSOLVED.



ONCE COMPLETELY DISSOLVED, TURN HEAT BACK ON and bring back to 155 DEGREES (or @ another 10 minutes).



LEAVE HEAT ON (Medium heat) and ADD HOPS DIRECTLY TO THE WORT. Do not use a grain bag or hop bag, you will not get the full bittering from the hop's acids. 



45 MINUTES with HOPS, STIRRING CONSTANTLY. 



TURN HEAT OFF.



COOL WORT: Here's how I do it - Plug the drain in your kitchen sink and fill with ice water (but only 1/2 to 3/4 full because of displacement). Then, put about a half gallon of ice water in the bottom of your fermenter bucket. Put the hot brew pot into the ice water in the sink, and add a little cool water or ice on top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Then rack the wort into the fermenter bucket with a siphon and racking cane. If the wort is still hot, it will cool when it hits the ice in the bottom of the fermenter bucket. I then turn the sink's cold water on to a trickle, trickling into the hot wort as it is being siphoned out. This cools it down, AND brings the volume up to 5 or 6 gallons of wort. Take care not to oxidize your wort.



ONCE THE WORT IS COOLED TO @ 75 degrees, add yeast. STIR. 

I ferment this beer between 72-74 degrees. 



With a Hefeweizen, a good rule of thumb for fermentations is this:

the colder you ferment, the more spicy, clove tastes will come out - the warmer you ferment, the more fruit tastes. This yeast can ferment as cold as 63 degrees or as warm as 86 degrees. 



I usually make this recipe into 6 gallons of lighter beer.



5 days to ferment (primary)

5 days to clear (secondary).

Once carbonated, it takes 2-3 weeks to ""age"" to the best taste. (sulphur dissipation).



Enjoy"

When the sugars are dissolved, dump the whole mess into a 5- gallon carboy, fit a blowoff tube and pitch the yeast. watch the liquid level in the carboy, and top up with fresh pear juice as needed.

Mash to a fine consistency adding water as necessary. Allow temperature to settle at 140 F. Add 2 oz. amylase enzyme and let sit as long as you have patience and care to monitor the temperature. This time affects to a great extent your conversion. It will become much thinner in consistency and sweeten. When you finally lose your patience (3 hrs for me) add the soup to the main mash and begin your protein rest for 1/2 hr. at 122 F. Raise temperature to 152 F and mash for 2 hrs. Mash out at168 F. Now you can add the Prerinsed rice hulls. Stir them in well, but reserve 1/2 lb. for the bottom of your lauter tun. Sparge with pH 5.7 adjusted water. Adjust pH with either lactic acid or acid blend. Boil the wort 1 1/4 hrs. Chill quickly. Divide wort into 2 carboys and allow to settle for about 2 hrs. or until the cold break is well settled. Rack the wort into clean carboys, aerate well by shaking the carboys, then pitch your yeast. Dry Munton Fison Ale yeast is excellent for this. Ferment at 68 F. When ferment is almost done, rack to secondary adding 1 tsp. of polyclar to each carboy. Allow to settle. This unfortunately is not sufficient to clarify the potato beer. After a week rack again and add 1 packet of dissolved gelatin (do not boil your gelatin) and set the carboy in as cool a place as you can find (not freezing). When clear rack into your cornelius kegs and force carbonate. And/Or bottle. Age 3 months for a very smooth mellow ale with a faint mashed potato flavor. The hops are very nice too."

110 F for 45 minutes

122 F for 45 minutes

144 F for 30 minutes

150 F for 90 minutes

Mash out 



I added the castor sugar to the primary to increase the OG to above 1.044 - I could/should have used light dry malt extract instead, but: 1) I forgot I still had some... 2) It tends to be messy stuff to work with (it sticks to everything!) and probably should be boiled for sterilization, etc. 



The total boil time was 60 minutes. The Irish Moss was added 30 minutes before the end of the boil. The zests and spices were added 10 minutes before the end of the boil. Hops added as specified in the ingredients list. 



I don't know if it's anything like a true Wit, but I thought it tasted great! I can't seem to taste the spices, so you could increase the amounts or maybe boil them for longer if you wanted to. As this was my first attempt, I didn't want to risk using too much spices."

I decided to reach a mash temperature of 155. Papazian said 16-18 degree temperature loss, so I got my water to 173 degrees and mixed it in a picnic cooler only to find that the temp came in at 145F! I spent the next 15 minutes or so, boiling more water and heating small amounts of the mash on the stove, so I could get starch conversion. After another 45 minutes I had full conversion, as per the iodine test and started sparging in a double bucket lauter tun system. I mixed the pumpkin in at this point, hoping the grain bed would filter out any pumpkin gook so I wouldnt wind up with a lot of pumpkin gook in the bottom of my fermenter. I sparged real slow, took me about 75 minutes. I went from there to boil, and I added all two ounces of cascade hops in the boil (advice from my brew shop owner). I kept the wort at a rapid boil for 60 minutes. I cooled using tubing submerged in iced water and siphoned into my fermenter. When the temp dropped to 80F, I pitched the yeast, hooked in my blow off tube and had a bottle of homebrew. My SG was 1.048 right about where I wanted it."

Washed, pitted, and ""juiced"" the aprocits to produce 1 1/2 quarts of delicious juice - added to hot must and turned off the heat for about 1/2 hour. Temperature was 190 degrees after adding fruit - dropped to about 180 degrees. Ran the must through my (new counterflow) wort chiller - in 15 minutes brought the temperature down to 80 degrees - and into 7 gallon glass carboy. Pitched yeast and fit the carboy with a fermentation lock. 



The must looks like raw apple cider at this point - cloudy and orangy/brown. I drank the must used for the gravity sample, and had a hard time stopping myself from sampling more - it was sweet, with a strong tartness of ripe apricots and undercurrents of ginger complimenting it nicely - tastes much better than beer wort! I was worried about too little fruit or too much ginger, but it seems very well balanced at this point - I hope the finished product keeps the same blend of tastes. 



Next morning: vigorous fermentation (3-5 bubbles/second) and about 1/2 inch of ""kreusen"" on the must. The smell is heavenly - like concentrated apricots, a little bit yeaste. I plan on racking to a secondary after a week, at which time I'll take another sample for gravity and tasting."

Time will tell if the crystal and chocolate will give the beer an undesirable harshness. I think you'd want a fairly soft finish in any weizen. I've tried this year's SA Summer Wheat (Dunkelweizen) and I think it's too harsh, as well as under-carbonated. The color's right, though."

Meanwhile I heated an additional 3 quarts of the same water to 180 degrees. After 30 minutes I pulled the grains from the pot and placed them in a colander and then used the additional water to sparge into the brewing pot. I then brought the pot up to a boil and added the 2lbs of dry malt extract and then the 7.5lbs of the liquid extract. 

Once the extracts were in, I added a hop bag with 1 ounce of cascade and 1 ounce of northern brewer and set the timer for a 60 minute boil time. I continued to stir so I did not burn the extracts until I knew they were completely dissolved. I kept the boil rolling stirring occasionally. At the 30 minute mark, I added a second ounce of the northern brewer to the boil, and then at the 5 minute mark I added the second ounce of the cascade and 2tsp of yeast nutrient. 

Once the boil was complete, I turned off the heat and allowed the wort to cool for awhile. I then transferred the wort into the primary topping up with the drinking water to the five gallon mark. After the wort reached around the 75-80 degree mark, I took the OG hydrometer reading which came out to 1070, and is around what I was shooting for. I then added 2.5tsp of yeast energizer, aerated the wort, then pitched the yeast, dry hopped with the third ounce of cascade and covered the beer. I let beer sit in primary for 5 days then transferred to the secondary, dry hopped an additional two ounces of cascade and let sit for ten more days. Beer fermented at 68 degrees for the entire process. On bottling day, I took the final gravity which came out at 1021. I added the carbonation drops to the bottles which work great, much better than making a sugar solution. and let sit in the bottle for 14 days. The beer tasted great on the first tasting on the 15th day and has since gotten better. One of my favorite homebrews I've made. Good enough to want to share."

Judges generally embraced this beer (although a couple were turned off by the large amount of roasted barley), but that has not prevented me from tweaking around the edges. While the above recipe served me throughout 1993, in 1994 I incorporated several suggestions from better judging sheets, resulting in New Stout III, which has remained unchanged since."

When your beer is done fermenting, you must rack it into a second sanitized vessel, preferably a glass carboy for which you have a fermentation lock. The beer and the hops are both added to that second vessel, and the beer is left from 1 to 3 weeks in the vessel. It isn't fermenting, but it's picking up flavors from the hops. If you don't want to do this, then instead of dry-hopping, add that last hop addition 2 minutes until end of boil. When you turn the flame off, let the beer sit with the lid on for 20 minutes before chilling it and racking it into the fermenter. But, I recommend that you try dry hopping sooner or later, as it adds flavor and aroma that is just right for this beer! English Pale Ale (previous recipe) also benefits from dry hopping."

After a weeks time, add 1 lb of sugar and let ferment. After about 2 weeks more, add the rest of the sugar. This will strengthen it and give a better flavor and keep the mead from ""drying out"". 



For fining the wine, take the shell from an egg that has been dried and powder it with a pinch of salt. Take this and add it to the white of one egg and some wine from your vat and gently stir all back into the brew. Let set for about 2 to 4 days and then filter and bottle the wine.

[If anyone knows a reasonable set of hops equivalencies, I`m all ears.] Northern Brewer is a very sharp hop that is a prime-requisite for British dark beers and stouts (and some pale ales); Goldings is a much ""rounder"" hop that is a prominent component of southern-English bitters. US brewers use yer best guesses, I guess. Procedure: I treat my water with 0.25 tsp salt per gallon to adjust pH; the water here (Bristol, in the SW) is fairly soft by UK standards but contains some dissolved CaCO3. I have had no difficulties whatever using tap water. I dissolve the malt extract and then boil the adjunct grains + hops in it for about an hour. I then strain a couple of kettlesful (kettlefuls?) of hot water into the primary through the spent grains and hops to rinse them. I dissolve the sugar in a couple of pints of warm water and add this to the wort, then top up with cold water to 5 gallons. When the wort is cool, I then measure OG (usually about 1035 to 1039), then add the lactose and pitch the (top-fermenting) yeast. The lactose gives just a hint of residual sweetness in the final brew; if that's not to your taste, omit it. This brew ferments to quarter-gravity stage in about 3 days when temperatures are about 20C (70F) and in about 5 days when temps are about 10C (mid-40s F). Final gravity is usually about 1005, resulting in ABV's of 4.5 to 5%. I prime my secondary fermentation vessel with about 1 tsp of dark brown sugar, and usually let it sit in the secondary 7 to 10 days, adding finings after the first 48 hours or so. I have not tried dry-hopping this recipe. I prime my bottles with 1/2 tsp of brewer's glucose; maturation is sufficiently complete in about 10 days, but obviously the longer the better."

Following Fred Eckhardt's description of Widmer's mash sequence, mash in at 122 degrees F and hold for 30 to 45 minutes, and then raise to 158 degrees F for starch conversion. Following conversion, raise to 170 degrees F for mash out and hold for 10 minutes. 



Primary fermentation should be done in the mid-60s. This beer benefits from cold-conditioning, so rack to secondary and ""lager"" at 40 degrees for a couple weeks."

This beer benefits greatly from a week or two of cold laggering in the bottle after carbonation. The color is lighter than Sam Adams Boston Lager and the flavor is somewhat similar. I've got to admit, I started brewing this for my wife and some of our less beer ""aware"" friends but I really enjoy it myself also."

Before bottling I used a wine thief to taste the beer. Since the heat from the chile was low I decided to steam a few chiles and ""dry spice"" in the bottle. I also made two bottles with unsteamed chiles. 



I'm not going to throw the chiles in the brew pot again. Very little spice was contributed from the six chiles I steeped. 



I'll not put one chile in each bottle again, either. Fortunately, I limited this to 8 beers. The steamed chiles made the brew overpowering. The unsteamed chiles were worse, with a mild infection that caused those beers to become hazy. The problem is not the heat. The dry spiced bottles are about as hot as Pace hot salsa. It's the chile aroma that makes the beer undrinkable. 



My next attempt will utilize dry spicing in the fermenter. I'll try 6 to 8 steamed chiles in a musslin bag. Also, I'll put more hops in the boil (1.5 oz of similar bittering hops). The chiles seem to provide heat and aroma, which leaves flavor wide open to bittering."

I then raised the it to a boil, added the boiling hops (the Northern) and the DME. After 60 minutes I added the flavor hops (.75 oz. of the spalt and 1.25 oz. of the Hallertau) and 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss. I then let this boil for 15 minutes (75 minutes total). 



I then put in my primary and added the Kolsch Wyeast (liquid, natch). This is an interesting yeast. I let it ferment at around 62-64 for about 1 1/2 weeks, until it seemed just about done. I then threw it into the fridge at 42 degrees for about 2 weeks. When I took it out, the yeast appeared upset by the sudden temperature change and it fermented rather energetically for about 1/2 day or so, and then it slowed down. I toook a specific gravity and it was 1.08. Done. (I screwed up the starting gravity. Ooops). 



I primed and bottled. Let it sit for two weeks, then placed it in the fridge. Let it sit in teh fridge about 1 week before drinking, and MMMMMMMMMMMM.....good stuff."

Add pectinase and amylase per manufacture's directions. Chestnuts are really a fruit and the pectinase will create a much clearer end product by dissolving suspended pectins. Add water needed to fill brewing pot. Allow to soak 12-24 hours [24 is better] to obtain maximum enzyme action. During soak, raise and lower grain bag a couple times an hour when possible to get maximum sugar extraction. At the end of the soak you should have a brix of 4-5%. 



Remove the chip bag and allow to drain as much as possible back into pot. You will lose 3-4 quarts of fluid aborbed into chips. Add 5 pounds corn sugar and add water to bring volume back. The brix should be 11-12%.



Bring wort to boil. Hops are up to brewer but I like Centinnials and Cascades. Add 2 ounces of hop in bag and boil for 30 minutes. Turn off heat and add 2 ounces of steeping hops for about 30 minutes or so. Chill wort as fast as possible with water coil cooler.



Transfer to 6.5 gal carboy along with yeast and airlock.



When fermentation is over, rack off into 2nd carboy along with fining agent. Airlock and allow settling to occur. Cold crashing really works well. 



After clarification re-rack and add maltodextrin and heading powder. These will give the beer texture and ""good mouth feel"".



You are now ready to bottle or keg. Use standard procedures for bottle carbonation."

Primary yield: 13.5 gallons

2lb Carapils



1lb Carafoam



1.5oz Tettnang 60 min

Wyeast 2124 Bohemain Lager



1lb light DME for 1 gallon yeast starter





I got an amazing 81% efficiency thanks to a long (2 hour) decoction-type mash with a lot of rests and a long (2 hour) sparge. A normal 60 min mash at 154 and a quick sparge at 170 would probably give you about 1.05, more appropriate for a Helles lager. I was not expecting such efficiency, it was mostly luck.





My mash schedule looked like this: 



20 minutes at 122



Pull out 1.5 gallon liquor, boil then return



20 minutes at 133



Pull out 1.5 gallon liquor, boil then return



20 minutes at 144



Pull out 1.5 gallon liquor, boil then return



60 minutes at 155



Drain and sparge at 170 in 3 batches (I did about 2-3 gal each batch) with a slow drip over 2 hours, 40 min per batch. Depending on the size of your lauter tun, just continue batch sparging until brew kettle is filled to desired volume (14 gallons).





60 minute boil. At flameout, I added 1 gallon of ice to drop temp to 180 then used wort chiller to 60.



Pitch yeast and ferment in 45 degree lagering cave for 1 week (this particular batch didn't finish for 10 days, then rack to secondary, lager for 1 month, then bottle. Leave at room temp for one week then return to cold storage.





Notes after primary: Primary fermentation took 10 days to subside. Very active for 6 days straight before a gradual slow-down. At first taste when racking to secondary, I received a strong floral hop aroma. A well-bodied mouthfeel with good initial bitterness and a clean pilsner flavor. Crisp finish with some floral hop notes. I am happy!





Notes after bottle conditioning: This is the finest homebrew I have made. Finally, after more than a year I have something I am truly proud of! I drank one after a few days in the bottle, and this pilsner is clear without additives, crisp and smooth. The flavor is spot on for a pilsner, and the color is definitely ""sunny"" but I wouldn't exactly call it a Helles. Based on the helles lagers I have tried in the past, the bohemian yeast gave it too strong of a pils flavor. If you want a true helles, consider using a german yeast strain. Cheers!"

You don't need to use a brew kettle. 



(2) Empty entire package of brown sugar and maple syrup into brew kettle



(3) Add enough water to allow for full dissolving of sugars



(4) Heat at a low-medium heat to mix all sugar producing ingredients. If too hot you may get caramelizing of the brown sugar at the bottom of the pot. 



(5) Transfer to carboy and fill remainder to 5 gallons; pitch yeast with raisins



(6) Check your OG and monitor until major fermentation has ceased. You may not have to leave the batch in secondary for very long, it should clear up quickly.



(7) Prime with 3/4 to 1 full cup of corn sugar. This can be consumed flat or carbonated depending on your preference. 



You will get a nice maple / raisin / apple flavor, best served chilled."

Add pectinase and amylase per manufacture's directions. Chestnuts are really a fruit and the pectinase will create a much clearer end product by dissolving suspended pectins. Add water needed to fill brewing pot. Allow to soak 12-24 hours [24 is better] to obtain maximum enzyme action. During soak, raise and lower grain bag a couple times an hour when possible to get maximum sugar extraction. At the end of the soak you should have a brix of 4-5%. Remove the chip bag and allow to drain as much as possible back into pot. You will lose 3-4 quarts of fluid aborbed into chips.



Bring wort to boil, and primary fermentable sugars, return to boil and achieve hot break.



Add hops, finings, remaining fermentable sugars and other ingredients according to schedule.



Chill wort until appropriate temperature to pitch yeast.



Allow bottle conditioning for three weeks



Brewing notes: Adapted from 'American Brown Ale' and Trails End Chestnuts 'Chestnut Beer'; produced a lot of trub, recommend starting with 6 gallons in primary with target of 5 gallons for bottling"

Pour crushed grains into grain bag and tie a loose knot at the top of the bag. When the water is within an appropriate steeping temperature (150º - 165ºF) place the grain bag into the brew pot.



Steep grains for approximately 20 minutes. Remove grain bag and without squeezing, allow liquid to drain back into brew pot. Your water is now wort.



Start boil: Bring your wort to a gentle, rolling boil. Add all of the included LME,DME and all of the corn sugar (it is not necessary to save sufficient sugar for bottling as indicated on the corn sugar label) to the

boiling wort Continuously stir the extract into the wort as it returns to a gentle, rolling boil



We suggest doing a 2.5 gallon boil at minimum. If you have the equipment to boil more than 2.5 gallons feel free to do so. There is no need to change the amount of any of the ingredients.



The grains should not be compacted inside the bag. Grains should steep loosely allowing the hot water to soak into all of the grain evenly

Strike with between 7 and 8 gallons of 175 F. degree water (YMMV) to get to about 155 F. When the temperature is stable (10 minutes), add the prepared oatmeal and stir gently. Let sit for 1 1/2 hours and begin sparge. Use enough water (9-11 gallons) at 170 F. to collect 16 gallons. Why 16? Because I like to drain 1 gallon off of the bottom for my next starter! 



After you've got the 15 remaining gallons in the boiler, ignite the jet engine or other device capable of supplying the heat that this big thermal mass will soak up. My experience is that I'm usually around 135 F. at the start. 



Steeping. Take the specialty grains and place them in a section cut from some nylon pantyhose and secure with a knot. Tye a string to this and drop into the kettle. About every minute or so raise the bag and allow to drain slightly. Steal a clear glass of the wort and check it for taste (should taste roasty and somewhat nutty, but not overpowering, because the sweetness that is presently balancing the taste will be gone after fermentation). My second test is the black cat test. Glance pass the glass to the black cat and color should be close. If you don't have a black cat, hold the glass up to a medium light and you shouldn't see through it. Take another sip. Yum. A word of caution, if you don't get the taste before 165 > 170 F. (you probably will well before), kill the heat and finish the steep before proceeding. 



The Boil. Approach the boil carefully (use a thermometer). The same things that give this beer its nice creamy head just ask for a boilover. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE KETTLE UNTIL YOU GET A HOTBREAK. At boil, add 1/2 ounce of Nugget (13% AA) or the equivalent AA% of a similar bittering hop and boil for an hour. 



Remove the Nugget, kill the heat. Add 1 ounce of East Kent Goldings + 2 ounces of Fuggles (I use a hop bag so you may want to reduce this quantity some) and turn on the cooling. Pitch yeast starter around 75 F. 



YOU MUST USE A BLOWOFF TUBE FOR THIS ONE. I have never made this batch without experiencing a good day's worth of eruptions. The Irish is nice, however, in that it finishes rather quickly, two weeks at most. Carbonate per your tastes. 



The starter. I use the Wyeast Irish Ale Yeast (1084?) puffed and pitched to a 1.050 starter. Leave yourself at least two days in advance to ""farm"" around 3/4 gallon of krausening starter."

Make a starter with the 3/4 # of DME and 1 gallon of water. Boil down to 3/4 of a gallon and cool with an airlock in place. Pitch a _well puffed_ pack of 3056. Let this go for two days. 



2. Preheat the mash chest with a quart or two of boiling water. Empty preheat water and mash in the grains with about 5 gallons of 140 F. to hit a protein rest around 122 F. After about ten minutes, withdraw 4 quarts of liquor from the bottom of the mash, bring to a boil, and add back to the mash. (This was to hold temp., you might not have to). 



3. After another ten minutes (20 minutes total protein rest), use about 4-5 gallons of boiling water to hit around 155 F. Hold for 45 minutes. Additional boiling water can be used if necessary, but should be avoided if possible. (I like to hold the extra H20 for sparge if I can). You can also withdraw a gallon at a time, bring to a boil, and return it to the mash (2-3 times max.) to hold temp. (Yes, I know that I'm over the 1 qrt./#grain recommendation...) 



4. Sparge right into the kettle using 7 gallons of 175 F. water. Go right to the boil (that's right, no mashout) and skim off the gray oily foam that comes to the top (subsides after 5-10 minutes). 



5. Boil down to 13.5 gallons and add the cascades. Boil for 60 minutes. 



6. Turn off heat and add the tettnanger. Let steep for about 15-20 minutes. Run through cooling unit to yield three four- gallon cuts to three 5 gallon fermenters. OG on my last run was 1.056. 



7. Pitch 1 qrt. of well mixed starter to each fermenter. Ferment at 70 F. for 2-3 days, until things settle down. Lower temp to 67-68 and ferment for another 11-12 days (total 2 week ferment). I use the brewcap system (except for stouts!) and tap the yeast that settles. Final gravity should be around 1.015 to 1.018. 



8. Siphon to keg, chill to 45 F. and C02 at 2.6 volumes (30 psi til it won't take any more, then go to about 17 psi). 



9. Bottle and age for at least three weeks. It's good off the keg right at day 0 but improves mucho by day 21!"

kegged and force carbonated at 8psi/40F, tapping after 18 days. At first, I was concerned that the dry hops had given it too much of a hop character, certainly more than present on the target.

If anything is wrong with the recipe, I think it gives a bit more body than Fuller's, so I will probably cut back slightly (maybe reduce the carapils from 1.5# to only 1#) next time. A"

Transferred them to a mesh strainer and shook to remove dust. I did this outside so as not to contaminate the kitcken. These were then placed with the oats (unground) into a grain bag. I preheated a 10 qt. (12-pack) cooler with boiling water, added the grain bag and 175 deg. water. Water cooled to the target of 160 deg. and steeped for 15 minutes. Things were working beautifully. I boiled the water and added the extract, CaCO3 and the steep liquor. This is where I have the question. 



In previous extract/grain batches I have steeped grains, then washed them in some of the unboiled water until the water ran ""clear."" I started to do this with the black/chocolate malts but obviously with the black grains it wouldn't have run clear. Eventually, the water I was using started to become the consistancy of thin syrup. If I continued to wash them I would have been there for days until the liquid began to thin and probably would have ended up with 10 gallons of wort."

Bacon extract: Cook bacon slices crispy and try to drain off as much of the bacon fat as possible; 

Crumble bacon, put in bowl, add enough vodka to cover and let sit; after two weeks, skim off any fat and strain bacon from extract using a fine mesh strainer or cloth (repeat as necessary); chill extract to congeal any remaining fat and skim (repeat as necessary).



Note: Bacon fat KILLS head retention!!! My first batch required a very rigorous poor to get a good head and even then it faded fast. It was still creamy and carbonated, but a stout with no foam is just not a stout! Anyway, it is essential to minimize the amount of fat in the bacon extract, so be diligent about removing fat from the extract."

I plan on mashing in the 30lb mash at 122F, and mashing in the 10lb mash at 155F. After the small mash has reached saccharification, I would proceed to boil it for 30 mins and then add it back to the main mash which would be then raised to 158F to convert. 



The small mash is done to avoid having to decoct and to attempt to get more maltiness by boiling all the munich malt."

Pour crushed grains into a large mesh bag, tie off bag opening(shake grains over top of your sink to release any small grain bits) and place in the kettle to steep and tie onto kettle handle.



Steep grains for 20 mins or untill the temp reaches 170F. While grains steep place the container of LME into a bath of hot tap water to thin. Next add the 1 lbs of DME into 1 cup of COLD tap water and whisk until dissolved.



Bring Wort to a boil.



Turn off flame, add the 6 lbs warm LME to the kettle while stirring to dissolve. Then add 1 lbs DME slurry to the kettle stirring to incorporate.

Put the grain bag in the cold water and bring the heat up to 160 degrees F. ""Steep"" the grains like a big teabag. Mix the grains around by squishing the outside of the bag with a spoon, lift the bag out to drain the water with the goodies into the pot. Mix squish and drain the stuff every 5 minutes for an hour. DON'T let the temperature exceed 170 degrees F during the steep to keep tannin extraction (creates a bitter flavor, especially with roasted and black grains) to a minimum. Pull out the grains and set them in a colander that hangs in the rim of your pot and pour a half gallon of clean water through them (preferred), or put them in a colander in a bowl so you can capture the stuff that runs out and add it back to your boil. 



I use pellet hops. Keep them in the fridge and use them as soon as possible. When done steeping the grains I add the first batch of hops (1 oz for this beer) and bring the water to a boil. Turn off the burner, add the Malt extract and stir it in till completely dissolved. Turn the heat back on, bring to a boil and check the clock. Depending on style you'll add different hops at different times. This recipe calls for 1 oz Perle at 60 minutes and 1 oz Perle at 30 min. You put the 60 min oz in first, then when there is 30 min left to the boil you add the second oz (add the spices here and maple syrup at end of boil for this beer). Boiled hops add the bittering character, some recipes call for hops at end of boil (sometimes called knockoff) which add aromatic character, some at transfer to secondary which really contributes to herbal or floral aromatics. A note regarding the boil, though a watched pot never boils, an unwatched pot of boiling wort will boil over - WATCH IT. 



Cooling and Transferring to Primary: Folks use all kinds of containers and techniques to cool and ferment, its a matter of choice. This is what I do. Transfer the pot to my kitchen sink, fill the sink with ice and cold water. Put 2 gallons of fermentation temp water (yes I chill water for lagers, I have been called compulsive) in a sanitized bottling bucket. Add the wort when it is cooled to fermentation temp and add water to 5 gallons (measure and make gallon marks on the outside of your bucket using tap water). I fill the bucket to about 1/2 inch above the 5 gal mark because the valve at the bottom of the bucket is about 1/2 inch above the bottom. Let it set for 30 minutes for solids to settle to the bottom of the bucket. Drain the wort into a 5 gal carboy leaving the solids (trub) at the bottom of the bucket. I use glass to keep characteristics from the last fermented batch, which plastic can retain, from getting into the next batch. Add (pitch) the yeast starter and set up a blow off tube. 



Primary Fermentation: When the yeast starts working you'll get a bunch of foamy gack (krausen) blowing out the tube. When the krausen subsides replace the blow off tube with an airlock. When the airlock activity slows (one bubble in 2 seconds for ale temp, one in 6 seconds for lager temp) use a racking tube to transfer (siphon) the stuff to a secondary fermentation carboy splashing as little as possible to minimize oxygenation. 



Secondary Fermentation: Here's where you add dry hops for secondary, sometimes spices or fruit. At lager temps I prepare hop pellets by boiling 16 of water, adding the pellets to the hot water, and pouring the green goo into the secondary fermenter before racking. At low temps pellets can float around the top like rabbit pellets and never really break up. At ale temps just toss them in. The action of racking often adds a trace of oxygen, fermentation picks up just a little, and/or forces some carbon dioxide out of solution, and the airlock activity may pick up a little. 



I do a secondary fermentation primarily for dry hopping and to help clarify the final brew (my beers normally have a light dusting of yeast at the bottom when finished instead of a 1/4 inch of murk found in some homebrews). I let it set a day or two after fermentation is complete and the hops (if I used any have settled). Rack to the bottling bucket and DON'T SPLASH - minimize oxygenation. If I dry hop I have a fine nylon netting which I sanitize and put over the end of the racking cane before transferring to the bottling bucket. 



Bottling: Carefully add 3/4 cup corn sugar boiled in 16 oz water to the bottling bucket and stir without splashing with a long sanitized spoon getting agitation from top to bottom of the bucket to ensure consistent priming. Bottle it. 



Bottle Conditioning: Bottle condition, to develop carbonation and such, at the appropriate temperature. Room temp for ale, lager temp for lager. Ales need 1 1/2 to 2 weeks (sometimes less if you're desperate), lagers from 3 to 4 weeks. 



This is my beer making ritual. I've been doing it just like this for over 3 years with never a spoiled batch. Always drinkable, often great, and sometimes excellent results. Every experienced homebrewer develops their own brewing rituals and preferences for ingredients and equipment. The matter of which is better is largely subjective."

I have posted this recipe to help alleviate the starting cider makers concerns (how do I get it sweet? How do I carbonate? etc.). So let me talk about these some.



First, it's true that comercial ciders are sweet and easy drink... but it's very difficult to make them at home. You see, commercial makers pasteurize their cider to prevent them becoming to dry (bitter) and then they force carbonate the bottles. Force carbonating involves a kegging system, bottled gasses, and lots of expensive equipment. So, how do we get a sweet, carbonated, cider using typical homebrew techniques... we don't. But, we can make a damn good cider that tastes like an applely white wine.



Ok, some things to know before making this. First, and most important.. the major mistake with cider is thinking it will be done in a week. It will be done in months... not weeks. I'll talk more about this later, but it's good to know this upfront.



Second, we are going to spike up the alcohol content and make an ""Apple-Honey Wine."" The reason for this is because if we raise the alcohol content to 12% or higher (this is something of a magic number in the wine world) the cider no longer needs to be carbonated to avert contamination. The alcohol becomes a preservative. I've made many batches and stored the five gallons resulting in very full and sealed half gallon mason jars. In order to raise the alcohol, we will add honey (you can use sugar, but it's watery and thin and it doesn't fit the rule of ""good ingredients make good product""). The addition of honey to cider creates a drink that's not a true cider... it's called a Cyser. This is an ancient name, and worth looking into its history, but I'll skip that for now.



Now, to the ingredients. We are only going to use a few things, as you can see. But, it's how we use them that will make the difference between a light and drinkable cider, or a funky sour batch.



First, boil a gallon or two of cider and pour in (while stirring) the honey. Yes, 5 lb. That will get the alcohol up to about 12%. The honey has to be boiled to kill toxins and it needs to be diluted so it will mix (no time limit on this, just till mixed and boiled, maybe 5-10 min). Add the boiled honey and cider to the carboy. Add the rest of the cool cider to make 5 gallons. Shake the carboy around to mix. Check the SG and the temp. Add the yeast when the temp is below 120.



Lets talk yeast, quickly. Avoid beer yeast with this recipe (it won't ferment all of the sugar). Only use a wine yeast that will leave residual sugars. Any home brew shop can tell you which ones will leave more apple aroma and sugars in the cyser. I use Montrachet. I never, ever, use Champagne.



Ok, here is where we start to get to the secret of this whole thing... the primary ferment of this is going to take 4 weeks. Maybe it will be shorter, maybe it will be longer... but plan for 4 weeks. When there is less than a bubble per minute, rack into a secondary (or back into your cleaned carboy). I like to rack back into the carboy because it's glass and it will bring us to our next important trick... when you have racked into your secondary, add a whole bunch of chopped apples, without the seeds, and then more juice to mostly fill the container (leave about 4-6 inches head space). The fresh apples in the secondary will add a -lot- of aroma and flavor, and the extra juice will reduce how much air the cyser is exposed to, which can ruin it. Put an airlock in, of course.



Important secret two... let this sit in the secondary for 2-3 months. Yes, months. This is where ciders tend to fail, and its a hard lesson to swallow, but cider, unlike beer, really needs a true ""secondary fermenation"" (google this, it's too much to explain the chemicals). This long period to finish will mellow the cider out greatly.



Now, rack and bottle. You don't have to carbonate, but you absolutely can, just like beer (5 oz priming sugar for 5 gallons) and bottle. Needless to say, if carbonated, don't use mason jars. Final secret... let this sit another 3 months or so. I know, it's a long time, but it will take forever to carbonate and even if not carbonated it will still need a long time to continue to mellow.



This will not produce a ""commercial cider,"" but that's pretty impossible anyway. If you try to make one, you'll just end up with bottle bombs or a very dry carbonated cider.



This, on the other hand, this is good. Really good. And old. This recipe goes back hundreds of years. I pretty much plan, when I make cider in October from fresh apples, to be drinking it in April. (to be honest, it will be palatable by Feb., but just keep waiting. Make some beer in the interim). If you have made a bunch of cider batches so far, but nothing like this, I highly recommend you give this a shot and see what you can take from it!"

I make a half gallon starter 2-3 days before brew day.



Steep your grains at 150 F ish for an hour. 

Let them drip back in for 30ish minutes and toss.

Bring the whole shebang to a boil, follow hop ""schedule.""

With about 10 minutes or less left to boil, add your sugars and a bit of yeast nutrient if you wish.

About this time, I have thought about adding blue or green food coloring to give it more of a St. Pats feel to it, but I cooked my sugar too long last time.

Load it up and let it ferment for 2 weeks.

Transfer to secondary, add 2 oz Equinox to dry hop for another 2 weeks.

Bottle, wait 2 weeks, crack open on the Spring Equinox and enjoy!

Prepare yeast according to manufacturers instructions.

2. Heat 14qt water to 173°F. (target water temperature of 154°F for 60 minutes)

3. Add grains, stirring until well blended.

4. Stir mash and check temperature every 20 minutes. If temperature is lower than 154F, add hot water to reach target of 154F.

5. At 40 minutes, begin heating sparge water (7 1/2 qt) to 175°F.

6. At 60 minutes, drain into boiling pot.

NOTES: 

Ensure boiling pot can hold a minimum of 6 gallons. 

Place a small piece of aluminum foil on top of grain bed to avoid direct pour of sparge water onto grain bed.

Drain first running's into a small pan and pour back onto grains to avoid excessive grain hulls into wort.

7. Slowly pour sparge water onto aluminum foil. Water level should stay around 1"" on top of grain bed.

8. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops and additions accordingly.

9. At the end of 60 minute boil, cool wort rapidly to 75-85F.

NOTE: Everything that comes into contact with wort must be sterilized from this point on!

10. Add cooled wort to sterilized fermentator.

11. Take gravity reading.

12. Pitch yeast.



After fermentation is complete, mix priming sugar and 1 cup water and boil for 5 minutes. Add priming solution to sterilized bottling bucket and siphon beer into the bucket. Wait about 15-20 minutes to bottle."

I use an immersion chiller, which brings it from 212F to 70F in 15 minutes, and then pour the beer through a large funnel into the fermenter on top of the yeast. I recommend the blowoff method of fermentation---non-blowoff versions of this beer have tasted harsh, astringent and too bitter. 



Primary fermentation: 3 weeks in glass at 66F. Dryhops added directly into fermenter (no hop bag) after kraeusen falls (about 4-6 days). No secondary. Boil the priming extract in 16 ounces of water for 15 minutes to sanitize."

Add 1 tsp yeast nutrient.

Add 1 tsp irish moss.

Add honey.





Bring back to a boil (yes, a full boil, which will almost certainly carmelize some of the honey, which will make for a little bit of nice residual sweetness) 



Turn down the heat and let the temp drop back to about 170F add raisins (ideally in a hop/grain boiling bag, so you don't have to fish out the skins later) 



Let the raisins steep in hot must/wort for about a half hour, maintaining temp in the 170-180F range. 



Optionally add 1/2 - 1 oz saaz hops (some don't like 'em. I do. Using Saaz hops will make for fairly minimal bittering) 



Put cold cider in sterilized, rinsed carboy. 



Pour in the hot stuff 



Add water to bring total to 5 gallons 



Wait for it to cool to 70F and pitch 2 packs yeast. I recommend either a) Red Star Champagne or b) Wyeast liquid champage yeast about equally. The Red Star is cheaper and provides me with good results. I double up on the yeast because when I only pitch one pack, I've had some slow starts, but never with two packs. 



When S.G. has dropped below 1.000, rack and bottle. If you add no priming sugar, this will end up very lightly carbonated. 



At an age of 3 months after bottling, this should be very drinkable. At a year after bottling, it should do well in contests. The main change between this and the Crazy-Good Mead recipe I posted is that one had blueberries and this one has raisins. More than 3 lbs of raisins in a 5 gallon batch will be too winelike for my taste. Earlier in its life, the fruit flavors will be stronger. They mellow with age. Depending on the color of the raisins, you should end up with something pink, from almost clear to white-zin color."

Meanwhile, put another pot on the stove and boil a gallon or two of water in it, then turn it off and let it cool with the lid on.

4. Put your hops in 3 small grainbags, an ounce in each. You don't have to do this, but it makes things a lot easier if you do.

5. Dump all the malt extract into the pot and stir it up until there are no clumps on the bottom where they could burn. Once it's all in solution, put the flame back on and heat it up to boiling.

6. When it's boiling nicely, skim the foam off the top and throw it away, then pop the Northern Brewers into the pot. Set the timer for 30 minutes. Don't put the lid back on. Keep it at a rolling boil.

7. When the timer goes off, toss one of your Yakima Goldings bags in and set the timer for 15 minutes.

8. Repeat Step 7 for the last ounce of Goldings.

9. When the timer goes off, turn off the flame, put the lid on the pot and cool it to room temp as fast as you can. Put it in the fermenter, top up to 5 gallons with the water you boiled earlier, check temp. It needs to be under 80 degrees. Cool it down some more if it's not there yet.

10. Pitch yeast, fit airlock or blowoff tube and let 'er rip.



I bottle conditioned mine for two weeks but the few bottles I snuck out early tasted fine. You could probably get away with just one week in glass if you were really thirsty."

American Brown Ale (~5.25 gallons)

my BROWN EYED GIRL Ale

Extract plus grain:



***Aiming for ~1.052 OG and ~1.014 FG***

**NAILED est. OG on brew day hit the est. FG after only FOUR DAYS ferm, bottled two days after that. No secondary.



Process

1.	Sanitize everything you think you will need. And have a bucket of Starsan standing by for the stuff you may forget and have ~20 lbs ice for the ice bath.

2.	Put 2 gallons Spring water in the fridge.

3.	In your 20 qt S.S. BK, bring ~2.5 gallons Spring water to a boil.

4.	Put your milled grains into a small, course strain, nylon bag and tie a knot in it and set aside.

5.	While the BK is heating up, in your small stock pot ,Bring ~one gallon Spring water to ~170*F then steep the bag of milled grains for ~30 minutes between ~145* - 155*F ***DO NOT let the water get higher than 170*F while steeping***

6.	Also while the BK is heating up, in another small pot, fill with tap water and heat (for heating the LME syrup can before you open it).

7.	Again, while the BK is heating up, in another pot, bring ~a 1/2 gallon Spring water to ~170*F (to rinse the steeped grains with after 30 minute steep is done).

8.	After steeping the bag of milled grains for ~30 minutes, rinse the steeped grains with the water from step #7 (@ <170*F) over the grain bag in the metal strainer, into the small stock pot of steeped grain water.

9.	After rinsing the steeped grains, give the grain bag a gentle squeeze in the strainer into the small stock pot of steeped grain water, then set bag of grains aside and discard grains later. The BK water should have reached boil by now.

10.	Turn off the heat on the BK once it has reached a boil, then add ~1/3 of the DME, the steeped/rinsed grain water (in the small stock pot), 2 oz. Fuggle hop pellets and stir all in well.***Add the DME first, before the steeped grain water and hop pellets in case of a boil over***

11.	Turn BK heat back on and resume boil for ~45 minutes.

12.	With ~15 minutes boil remaining, turn BK heat off and add in the remaining DME, LME, 1 oz. Fuggle hop pellets and 1 Whirfloc tablet. Stir all in well.

13.	Heat ~a 1/2 cup Spring water in the microwave and use it to rinse all extract out of the LME can. Pour into the boil kettle.

14.	Resume boil for ~10 minutes.

15.	While the wort is boiling, in a small pot, boil ~ 1.5 cups Spring water for ~a minute or 2 (to rehydrate the yeast, yeast energizer and yeast nutrient with).

16.	At ~5 minutes boil remaining, add in 1 oz. Willamette hop pellets.

17.	After ~60 minute boil is done, place BK immediately into an ice water bath in the kitchen sink, DO NOT COVER, and cool down in <= 20 minutes, to <= 100*F (cover the stock pot only while adding water/ice to the bath so you dont accidentally spill any into the wort).

18.	Pour ~1.5 gallons cold Spring water into the FV(6.5 gallon ale bucket is what I used).

19.	In a small bowl, re-hydrate dry yeast in ~3/4 cup sterile Spring water (from step #15 when it is at ~80*F). Let the yeast sit still and rehydrate for ~15 minutes, then stir gently for another ~30 minutes. ***First time using this yeast, it takes a bit longer, ~45 minutes, to rehydrate, and you only use ~80*F sterile (boiled Spring water)***

20.	In another small bowl, rehydrate the yeast energizer and nutrient in the other ~3/4 cup sterile Spring water (from step #15).

21.	When the wort is cooled down to <=~100*F, pour the wort, through the strainer, into the FV (straining is of course optional, don't strain your wort if you don't want to, it was kind of a pain with all the hop trub clogging the strainer before I had poured all the wort into the FV but think I ended up with more ale because I did, I think)

22.	Top up to ~5.25 gallons with Spring water.

23.	Add in the rehydrated yeast energizer and nutrient into the fermenter.

24.	Get SG,wort temp, and pH measurements.

25.	At this point, if the SG is < 1.052, you can add in Avocado Honey to raise it to ~1.052.**Didn't have to, hit the OG perfect.**

26.	Aerate the wort vigorously while waiting for the yeast to finish rehydrating.

27.	When the wort is at appropriate ~(room) temperature, and the yeast has re-hydrated, pitch the yeast (***There should be less than a 10*F temperature differential between the wort and the re-hydrated yeast temps).

28.	Give it another good stir and put on the lid with airlock.

29.	Primary fermentation should be over in ~7 days.(Hit FG in FOUR DAYS, bottled two days later)."

I have found that fermenting in a carboy and keeping the carboy submerged up to the neck in about 72 degree F water and keeping a wet towel around the neck really helps to keep the fermentation temp. constant due to the thermal mass chacacteristics of water. Try this if you are bewing in hot weather this summer."

I used the theoretical values in Miller's CHoHB, and the SG points avail- able from the grain bill were 290. Multiply 58 by 5 and be amazed as I was! Yes, I got 100% of theoretical extraction, and only sparged 5 gal.! How? I'll describe my sparge procedure this time, because I believe herein lies the key. 



For lautering, I use the bucket in bucket tun. I'd suspect that it's the same as many other brewers use. It isn't insulated, or anything fancy. Sparge water was acidified with lactic acid ala Miller. Here's the difference. I recirculated the initial runoff for the equivalent of 6 gal. Then I began the sparge with 1/2 of the water heated to 170F and recirculated it once. I finished up with the last 2.5 gal., which was also recirculated once. Total sparge time was about 2.5 hours. The sparge was a good bit longer than usual, but those results!!! The runoff was reheated between recirculations, BTW. The last runnings had no preceivable tannic taste."

Ferment in primary vessel for a minimum of 5 days. I found 7 days to work well. A secondary fermentation is mandatory on this beer to get the proper body and clarity. I recommend a minimum of 2 weeks in the secondary vessel. Bottle off with 6-7 oz of priming sugar. I like a very aggressive carbonation, so you can scale back to 5 oz for less.

I don't use a hydrometer, but my own calculations show the alcohol content to be around 7-8%. I scaled the water back a bit to 4 1/2 gallons to boost alcohol content by volume. I figured this yielded around a 9% content."

Returned to mash for mashout. Sparge with 5 gallons water. 



Once boil is established, begin hop schedule. I added two quarts distilled water 30 minutes into the boil (it was a warm day and the boil was rolling nicely). I added my immersion chiller with 30 minutes remaining. After cooling, I added 1/2 teaspoon HopTech Foam control to a sanitized 6 gallon carboy, then carefully poured the cool wort through a stainless steel strainer nested in a large funnel. After chilling the wort further in a water bath to 58F, I aerated the wort using an aquarium pump, 0.22 micron filter, and aquarium airstone for 30 minutes. 



The yeast, which came from a bottle of Black Butte Porter, was stepped up to a 2000ml starter. I think the fermentation temperature might have been too cold (60F) because it took almost 36 hours to reach active fermentation. Temperture was maintained at 60F for seven days, then racked to secondary, where temperature was allowed to stabilize at 65F for two weeks. Bottled using 5/8 cups corn sugar.

Added strained juice of 6 fresh off the tree Florida lemons and 4 fresh Florida limes - 16 oz. 



Stirred a few times for 30 min. Temp back up to 90 - kept there. Added juice with pulp - 6 more lemons and 4 limes. Some hot break forming and moving. Chopped remainder peels and coriander in chopper and added. Let sit 10 min. Heat off. Final Temp at 90C. Stirred well (whirl pooled). Covered with saran wrap, put lid back on and ice bathed (lots of ice) for 2.5 hrs. Removed saran wrap to find a nice conical forming upward from the center of the brew pot - from whirl pooling. Clear with spices and fruit mostly in the center. Some haze in suspension. Racked to carboys. 2.5 gal. got the a champagne yeast starter and 3.5 gals. got the Wyeast Mead Sweet yeast starter. Both were started with a honey based starter solution at ~1.050 - 1.5 liters for 1 week repitched twice. 



OG of the must was ~1.14 - only way to measure was to cut in half with water and measured 1.070. Nice citric smell and taste. Tried to keep temp at 68-75F for fermenting. Champagne carboy was racked at 40 days and bottled 35 days later, very clear and went straight into bottles. FG is 1.020. Kinda hot for my liking. 



Racked the Wyeast Sweet carboy in 2 weeks down to 1.065 and bottled 2 months later, very clear and still, no prime - straight into bottles. FG is 1.045. This may be considered by some to be a metheglin but the honey and alc's really come through and balance well with the fruit and spice flavor. No nutrients were used. This is the 1st place traditional mead for the '96 MCMC. Judge comments include:""Excellent cacophony of flavors - - this is so big yet well balanced to the Nth degree - clean, not burning or rough"" - ""Well balanced and very mellow - clean finish and big strength - great job!"" ...

So: I boiled 1 gal. water, added 1 gal honey, and all the flavorings, and brought the temperature up; I figured I'd let the scum rise & skim it off, but not actually boil it. Didn't occur to me that a lot of the flavorings would float.... 



I skimmed off the scum (and most of the raisins & mace & lime), and pulled out about half the ginger (the more I thought about it, the more I began to doubt using so much...). Eventually, the scum slowed down; I cut the heat off, added the herb extract, and set it in the sink to cool (that was the weekend it was 50 below in Minnesota, so no ice was necessary ;)). 



Because of the herbs, I kept the pot covered. In future batches, I'll just add the already-pasteurised extract to the pitching bucket & save myself the extra grief. 



When the must had cooled to 95F, I poured it into the bucket, along with a half-gallon of ice water, snapped on the lid, and shook it hard for a while. Pulling the lid off, I dipped a test sample, and pitched the starter. 



Original gravity is 1.1225 (!) 



After repeating the shaking, I poured off into a 3-gal carboy. O gawd, it's filling up too fast - do I have another jug? Found a half-gallon jug, did a quickie sterilisation on it (difficult to do w/ crossed fingers), and gave it the rest. (Turns out I have almost *exactly* 3 gallons, but hey....) 



Eighteen hours later, it's bubbling once every 10 seconds! 



03/04/96 - After a month, it had slowed to once in 40 seconds, so yesterday afternoon, I poured the half-gallon into the carboy, added 3 yeast energiser tablets, and 2 teaspoons of yeast hulls. As of 19:52 today, it's bubbling every 7 seconds."

I quickly realised that the pot I was cooking in was running out of room, and I still had plenty of fruit to go! 



I grabbed my half-gallon pyrex cup & scooped out about 3 pints, and added the rest of the fruit to it, stuck it in the microwave & zapped it several times, stirring after each zap, while struggling to get a completely-full 4-gallon pot off the stove and into to sink to cool. *sigh* Not all the must made it. 



The stuff was thick as anything and *extremely* sweet (apparently even more so than my first must (SG=3D1.1225)), so I figured I'd better dilute it some...oops, then I had 6.5 G of must filling up my 6.5 G fermenting bucket! *sigh* Now it's a two-carboy batch...at least there was room for the yeast! 



Ever try to pick up a *full* 6.5 G bucket & pour it *all* into a funnel perched on top of a carboy? *sigh* Of course you haven't, and neither have I: I started bailing into the funnel, and making an incredible wreck of the kitchen...which I then managed to track all over the carpet.... 



By this time, I had fruit clogging the funnel, pools of fresh honey-glue creeping across my kitchen counters and floor, sticky spots on the floor throughout the house, and two open carboys, but I finally got the fruit distributed between the bottles, got the fruit *rammed* through the funnel and *into* the carboys (*grrr*), locks installed, and everything cleaned up (or at least, wiped down)."

Placed pot with lid inside cooler and wrapped in towel. Only lost about 5 degrees over 45 minutes. Washed grains with 2 quarts hot water (about 170 degrees). Total boil was about 2 gallons. Added DME and LME at about 180 degrees and once boil started, added 1 oz Cluster. At 30 and 5 min added .5 oz Hallertau. 20 min to go added peeled and pounded ginger (2 oz), 1 tsp cloves, 1 crushed nutmeg, 6 cinnamon sticks, and 1/2 tsp of Irish moss. All of the spices were added to a muslin bag. The ginger was peeled and then hit with a mallet to allow for more surface contact with beer. Used 5 trays of ice to cool and result was 2 gallons. Filled rest with cold tap water. Got down to 70 degrees that way very quickly. Dry hopped with 2 cinnamon sticks, 10 cloves, 1 crushed nutmeg. 



I think that the next time I do this brew, I will dry hop with a little less spice. The nutmeg was a little strong at first but mellowed out. Priming was done with 3/4 cup of dextrose boiled in 1 cup of water for 15 minutes to dissolve and sterilize. 



The Wlabs English Ale Yeast was GREAT. Brewed on Tuesday, December 23, 2008 between 12-4. First sign of fermentation was noticed on Christmas morning. Nothing was observed Christmas Eve (around 10 PM)...so ETF (estimated time of fermentation) is somewhere between midnight ant 10 AM. Fermentation was complete very quickly."

Primary ferment was one week at 68 degrees. Secondary ferment was one week. 



For the dry hop I just threw them in the secondary. The hops float so you can siphon from underneath them. The longer you dry hop the more the hops get ""water logged"" and start to sink. You may want to try 5 days instead of 7. When I transferred it to the bottling bucket I did get some hops in there. Wracking to a second bottling bucket might help but I was to lazy. 



I did waste a little more beer than usual during bottling trying to avoid the hops. It is worth the extra effort to use whole hops. The hop nose is awsome. 



If you do a full boil, you may want to cut back on the bittering hops a bit. Mine was nicely bitter (maybe a bit more than Liberty)."

Doughed in pale malts only. Mash-in temperature was 150F after stabilizing. Mashed at 145-155 (added 1 qt of 180F water when temp dropped to 145F). Conversion complete in one hour. Crystal was added at mash-out. Dumped 20 qts of 180F water into tun and stirred (mashout and batch sparge in one step). Sparge was very slow, nearly stuck twice, so I back flushed the copper manifold to loosen it up (need to adjust my grainmill!). Start of boil, the volume was around 32 qts. Boiled down to 22 qts. at 1.045. Points of extract = (45pts. * 5.5 gal.) / 9.75 lbs. = 25 pts/lb/gal. 



Hopping schedule:

60 min: 0.50 oz MH IBU = 8.3

30 0.50 MH 4.5

0.50 Cp 5.8

10 0.50 Cp 2.5

dry 0.60 Cl 1.0 (leave on for 10 days)

----

Approximate Total IBU = 22.1 (Balanced beer at 1.045 = 20 IBU)





A note about hopping: I was attempting to get most of my IBUs later in the boil to reduce some back of the tongue bitterness. I wanted this to be a hop flavored beer, rather than just have bitterness to balance the malt. On most beers I try for 50-60% of the bitterness at the 60 minute addition, but as you can see, I did not do that here. I achieved my goal I think (see tasting notes). 



Full fermentation in 12 hours, high krauesen in 36 hours. Dry hops were just thrown on top of beer in secondary."

Use dry malt because you can measure it out, unlike syrups. The crystal malt should be cracked. Your homebrew supply store can do that for you. Steep the crystal malt for 30 minutes in your water at 150 degrees F. Then strain the husks out, bring the water to boil, add the gypsum or salt, and add the dry malt. After the wort has been boiling for 10 minutes, add the first hops and follow the hop schedule indicated above. Hops are English hops. Brown sugar can be added as soon as the boil starts. If you use dry packaged yeast, use the above brands. Others are lousy! If you like the recipe, vary only the yeast, and you get a somewhat different beer next time!

Kept it there for 30 min. Everything went fine until I started adding the fruit to the must. I quickly realised that the pot I was cooking in was running out of room, and I still had plenty of fruit to go! 



I grabbed my half-gallon pyrex cup & scooped out about 3 pints, and added the rest of the fruit to it, stuck it in the microwave & zapped it several times, stirring after each zap, while struggling to get a completely-full 4-gallon pot off the stove and i nto to sink to cool. *sigh* Not all the must made it. 



The stuff was thick as anything and *extremely* sweet (apparently even more so than my first must (SG=1.1225)), so I figured I'd better dilute it some...oops, then I had 6.5 G of must filling up my 6.5 G fermenting bucket! *sigh* Now it's a two-carboy b atch...at least there was room for the yeast! 



Ever try to pick up a *full* 6.5 G bucket & pour it *all* into a funnel perched on top of a carboy? *sigh* Of course you haven't, and neither have I: I started bailing into the funnel, and making an incredible wreck of the kitchen...which I managed to track all over the carpet.... 



By this time, I had fruit clogging the funnel, pools of fresh honey-glue creeping across my kitchen counters and floor, sticky spots on the floor throughout the house, and two open carboys, but I finally got the fruit distributed between the bottles, got the fruit *rammed* through the funnel and *into* the carboys (*grrr*), locks installed, and everything cleaned up (or at least, wiped down). 



No, I'm fine, really...*pant*pant*pant*.... 



The result? I now have +/- 7 gallons of fruit-punch melomel producing CO2 in industrial quantities: bubbling about every 1.5 seconds. The stuff smells and tastes heavenly, but the must is really much too sweet for me to drink, even though the starting gravity is 'only' 1.090. 



This batch was much more work than my first one, even though the first batch took me a full 2 days, what w/ the herbs and all. Partly, I was thrown by my mis-calculation of the must's volume, and that had me playing catch-up from then on. 



03/04/96 - After 48 hours, it's bubbling once every second, and still smelling incredible! 



03/05/96 - I just noticed what seems to be a crack in the 5-gallon carboy, and (very) minor seepage around it. Was this crack there before? Did I somehow knock the bottle against another, and if so, is there *loose* *glass* in my mead??? I suppose CARE FUL racking might take care of it.... I would *hate* to have to throw this out!"

I waited 36 hrs (w/fermentation lock on) before pitching the yeast starter. As recommended in the book, I brought the room temp up to the upper 70s for the first couple of days and gradually brought it down to the mid to upper 60s for the remainder of the fermentation. The fermentation was active w/in 12 hrs. At its peak, it was bubbling like a coffee percolator (2-3 times per second) for the first few days. 



A 1""-2"" thick orange foam formed at the surface which I resuspended by ""swirling"" the carboy w/ the fermentation lock on (2x/day for the first few days only). The fermentation lasted less than 10 days. On the 12th day, I took a gravity reading of 0.994! The recipe recomended first racking at a reading of 1.005; I would have taken readings more frequently if I realized how quickly it would go. At that time, it tasted dry (no sweetness), somewhat harsh, with little orange flavor or aroma. 



The color has been a deep orange brown and has been very clear since fermentation ended. After 2-1/2 months, it's dry but seems to be improving; more of a tangy orange taste. I used my new acid testing kit to get an acidity reading of 0.6%; right at the recom. level for fruit wines. 



Only speculation at this point, but next time, I would use more honey and begin fermentation in smaller containers without the juice, rack at a gravity of around 1.050 (while fermentation is still active) into a larger carboy onto the juice. Hopefully, this would lead to a slower fermentation with less of the honey and juice flavors going ""up in smoke"" so quickly. I'd also try to have less head space to avoid possible oxidation problems. If I added any acid it would only be malic and/or tartaric (OJ should have been plenty of citric already). Lastly, I'd ferment at 60degrees and maybe finish off around 75 degrees for a short time only after the fermentation slowed. My other mead batches have started strong and done well at this temperature. Oh yeah, I'm also ordering some Florida fresh orange blossom honey."

The honey or brown sugar will boost the starting gravity as well as contribute to the flavor and body of the finished beer.

First a real basic lesson on how it works: Yeast turns Sugars into Alcohol & CO2, so, since Honey is a complex sugar ya get a lot of punch out of it, (as some of ya'll that have already had my stuff before know!) This stuff is so easy to make & the Vikings called Mead the Nectar of the Gods, so it's got to be good right???

To brew your first batch of Mead you'll need several inexpensive gadgets.

- Primary fermenter, (6 gal food grade plastic Bucket with lid, & rubber Grommet for airlock)

- Bottling bucket with spigot, 6 gal., food grade plastic , need tubing & bottling wand w foot-valve (to get the mead into your bottles)

-Airlock (ask them for the wine style airlock as you want to run this out, you will be using Champagne yeast) 

-B-Brite cleaner, 

-Bottle capper/caps 

-B.F.S. (Big F*cking Spoon) Food grade plastic

-Champagne yeast 

-They also sell bottles, or you can reuse regular, non-twist-off bottles. 



Other Ingredients 

10 lbs Honey (I usually go online & find the cheapest Clover Honey I can get like at Amazon.com or do a Google search) 



Vanilla Extract (any grocery store) I add this to the bottling bucket before bottling (1 Tablespoon per gallon of Mead to smooth out the taste a little right before bottling) 





OK ya Mugs! Now that ya got the gear, Here's what to do with it!!



#1 pour 5 gallons of water into the bucket scratch a mark so you know where the 5 Gallon mark is.



#2 Sterilize your stuff with the B-Brite cleaner & Hot water, & rinse it out well



#3 Get 10 Lbs of Clover Honey (for a 5 gallon batch leave a gallon air space in bucket this stuff will blow the airlock & spray all over if ya don't) warm the honey containers under hot hater so you can pour it out easier, use more warm water to rinse the Honey containers out adding it to the bucket till you reach the 5 gallon mark. Stir with B.F.S.



#4 the Champagne yeast will work best around 70 degrees don't put in until your batch is around that temperature if its too hot you will kill the yeast 



#5 add the yeast depending on what type of champagne yeast you get it will have directions on if you need to do anything to activate it or not



#6 put the lid on your bucket, put your airlock into the lid and fill with water to the mark on the airlock (the air lock lets the CO2 out - but keeps air from getting in and growing any funky stuff on your mead,)



#7 Put the bucket somewhere out of the way but where you can give it a swirl every once in a while & check out the airlock every once in a while to make sure there is still water in it.



#8 Repeat #7 until it stops bubbling (usually about a year)



#9 Sterilize your bottles (I use my dishwasher with the bottles pointing down and 1 Tablespoon of the B-brite to sterilize them).



*Make sure there is no funk in the bottles sometimes folks don't rinse their bottles out well enough & there may be some mutant penicillin growing in the bottoms if so just chuck those bottles! 



#10 Sterilize your bottling bucket hose & wand & B.F.S. with B-Brite,



#11 Pour the mead from the fermenting bucket into the bottling bucket, add the Vanilla extract 1 Tablespoon per gallon of Mead, stir with B.F.S., then put the bottling bucket up on a counter (you use gravity & the wand to get the mead from the bucket into your bottles).



#12 Put the bottles in a bucket or something while you fill them in case you overflow, Mead makes a rather sticky mess put the wand (with the foot valve into the bottle & press down, fill till mead reaches top of bottle remove wand the air space left by the wand coming out is what you are after! do not top them off ! or they will blow off the caps and you will lose a years worth of work and have one hell of a mess!!! 



#13 Cap the bottles with the capper



#14 They are ready to drink when ever, Some folks like to let them sit and age in the bottle, I seldom have em last that long! 



Enjoy! *watch this stuff it kicks some serious ass!!! 



#15 Make sure to clean & sterilize all your equipment, I recommend starting the next batch at this time as it takes a year for your next batch."

I fetched my water from a local Water Mart. This is Reverse Osmosis (RO) water, and could be too thin for a (India) Pale Ale. Thus, I add gypsum. I could have added Burton Water Salts at the expense of quaffability.

Sanitize all equipment at every stage of use.



2. Fill large pot with 2.5 gallons water. Heat water to 155F and add grains in steeping bag. Maintain temperature and steep for 20 minutes. Remove/drain nylon grain steeping bag.



3. Bring water to a moderate boil. Remove briefly from heat and add LME and DME, stirring thoroughly until dissolved. Return to heat and resume boil. Immediately add one muslin hops bag filled/sealed with 3/4 ounce of hops (This is the bittering hops stage). Maintain boil for 45 minutes, stirring regularly. NEVER LEAVE YOUR POT UNATTENDED as it may boil over.



4. At 45 minutes of boiling, remove pot briefly from heat and add one crushed Whirlflac tablet and honey, stirring thoroughly until dissolved. Return to heat and continue boil, stirring regularly.



5. At 55 minutes, add a second muslin hops bag filled/sealed with 3/4 ounce of hops (this is the aroma hops stage). Return to heat and resume boil, stirring regularly..



6. At 60 minutes, remove the large pot from heat and place in sink filled with iced water, cold water or use a wort cooler. Do not stir the wort during the cooling stage. Fill your primary fermentor with 2.5 gallons of room temperature water. When the mixture (wort) reaches about 80F, remove pot from sink and pour contents into your primary fermentor. (Optional: pour your wort slowly through sanitized stainer into the fermentor if you have a strainer). Fermentor should be filled to about 5 gallons now.



7. Take an OG reading with a sanitized hydrometer, should you own one. Record this value.



8. Oxygen must now be infused into the wort prior to yeast addition. Stir wort vigorously for up to five minutes with large sanitized spoon or stirring paddle. You may also pour wort back-and-forth between two seperate sanitized buckets.



9. Add room-temperature yeast to wort once the wort temperature has reached 72F to 75F. Stir yeast thoroughly into wort. Now place a lid on your primary fermentor (with fermentation lock filled and secured into lid)



10. Place fermentor in a dark room or area, where it's temperature can maintain a consistent 68F to 73F. Primary fermantation should begin within 18 to 36 hours of yeast introduction. Primary ferment will last between 5 to 7 days.



11. At between 5 to 7 days of primary fermentation, the wort may be transferred into a sanitized secondary fermentor. Be careful to avoid transferring trub (sediment) from the primary into the secondary. 



12. Bottling: bring one cup of water to a moderate boil in a medium pot. Add 5 ounces of priming sugar and stir regularly. Remove from heat. Transfer your wort into a sanitized bottling bucket, avoiding any trub. Gently stir your priming sugar water thoroughly into the wort and begin filling your sanitized bottles to within an inch of their tops. Cap with oxygen barrier beer bottle caps and place in dark room/area at roughly 70F.



13. Conditioning: allow beer to carbonate for at least two weeks in bottles. This brew should be drinkabl after two weeks, though it will improve noteably if allowed to condition for one to two months. This ale is best if consumed within one year's time."

I use a 6 gallon fermenter.



Fill your boiling pot with 2 gallons of room temp water and add the Gypsum and Calcium.

Fill your lauder pot with 1 gallon of room temp water and add the 2 large Apples after slicing them thinly an removing all the seeds, leave the skin on.

The Apples add a complex character to the mash.

Allow your boil pot to rapid boil for at least ten minutes.

It's a good time to put on your eye protection and gloves!

Add all 14 pounds of grain to lauder pot and stir the cold mash, add all boiling water and stir for a minute to saturate the grains.

Cover the lauder pot let the grain rest.

Add 2 gallons of water to your boil pot again and after boil add it to the mash and stir again for a minute.

Allow the grain to rest for at least an hour, covering the lauder pot with a heavy towel will help to maintain temperature.

After the grain is well rested and cooled to at least 120~125 degrees, drain 

off to your boil pot or a secondary hold pot. You should be able to get almost 5 gallons of liquid.

Return the brew to a boil and hold the boil for at least 60~90 minutes.

Add Hops & Whilfloc tablet or Irish Moss and let boil for another 15~20 minutes. Warm your yeast up to room temp.

I recommend using a wort chiller to bring the brew temperature quickly down to 80 degrees. Draw off about a cup of 80 degree wort and check OG, it's a good time to taste it too. When done add yeast to it, stir until dissolved completely. Pour off wort to fermenter through a large funnel with 400# screen to block hops, best pitch temp is 80~75 degrees, now pour in yeast mixture and set airlock. Be sure to locate fermenter away from sunlight and maintain 75 degrees or cooler.

After 14 days of primary move to secondary fermenter, be sure to sterilize it properly; Strong Ale doesn't require a secondary, it can stay in the primary if you wish. When day 60 arrives rack off to a keg and CO2 pressure to 2 atmospheres. Wait another week then chill the keg and serve my Strong Beer with food.

Before a boil was reached, grains were removed and sparged through two strainers, (one coarse and one medium). The malt extract, gypsum, and boiling hops were added and boiled for 55 minutes. About 15 minutes from end of boil, yeast was rehydrated by standard method [note: standard method consists of removing 1 ladleful (approx. 1/4 cup) of boiling wort and diluting to 1 cup with cold water in a sanitized 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup. It is then cool enough to add the yeast immediately. The Pyrex cup is covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band.] At end of boil, immersion wort chiller was placed into brewpot, the finishing hops was added, and the brewpot was removed from the heat. The pot was immediately transferred to the sink and the chilling begun. The brewpot lid was placed over the chiller and the gap between pot and lid was sealed with plastic wrap. After chilling for approximately ten minutes, the wort was transferred to the primary, straining out the hops pulp in the process. Wort was diluted to five gallons with jug-aerated water. [Note: jug-aerated water refers to the following: cold tap water is added to the fermenter 1/2 gallon at a time to make 5 gallons. Each 1/2 gallon is shaken vigorously for 30 - 60 seconds in a sanitized plastic gallon jug to aerate. This may also help dechlorinate the tap water.] Some cold tap water was blended with warm to produce a final temperature between 65 and 70 degrees in the fermenter. The yeast was pitched immediately. The original gravity was measured to be 1.060 at approx. 67 degrees --> 1.061 corrected. Fermentation was carried out at approximately 62 degrees. Primary fermentation continued to 18-Nov-92, when beer was racked to the secondary fermenter. Batch was kegged on 7-Dec-92; final gravity: 1.015 @ 60 degrees --> 1.015 corrected. Alcohol content was computed to be 6.0375% by volume, 4.83% by weight."

No reviews","7 1/2 lbs. British Mild Malt","1 lb. Home-made amber malt","1 lb. Vienna malt","1-1/4 tsp. Irish moss (15 minute boil)","6 pounds wildflower honey (boil 15 minutes)","Wyeast #1728 (Scotch ale)","null","null","null","null","null","null","For both recipes, first make a pound of amber malt. Using pale malt, spread to a depth of 3/4 inch in a glass or aluminum foil lined baking dish. Preheat the oven to 100 degrees C (230 F) and bake for 45 minutes to dry the malt. Increase the temperature to 150 degrees C (300 F) and continue to bake for another 45 minutes. Cool and set aside for a week or so in an air-tight zip lock bag. This allows the malt to mellow and avoids possible harsh flavors. 



Crush malts and mash in to stabilize at 60 degrees C (140 F). Hold for 20 minutes. Raise temperature to 68 degrees C (155 F) and hold for 60 minutes for full conversion. Mash out and sparge with 4 3/4 gallons (US) water. 



Boil 60 minutes. Add 1 1/4 tsp. Irish Moss for the last 15 minutes of the boil. After 60 minutes, add 6 pounds of wildflower honey and boil for 15 minutes, constantly skimming and discarding the foam. 



Force chill, aerate and pitch with 1 qt. yeast starter. I used (and recommend) Wyeast # 1728 (Scotch Ale). 



Primary fermentation: 30 days at 18 degrees C (165 F) in glass

Secondary: 130 days (same temp, in glass) 



At bottling, make up a cup of yeast starter, and inoculate with a pack of Wyeast # 1056 (Chico ale) a day before bottling. Adding this fresh yeast to the bottling bucket will get carbonation going faster. Carbonate with 1/2 cup white table sugar (sucrose) boiled for 5 minutes in 1 1/2 cups of water (cool before adding to bottling bucket). Sample after 2 weeks. Improves greatly with age. 



For using malt extract: 



Make and crush amber malt as above. Soak crushed amber malt in 1/2 gal. water at 65 degrees C (150 F) for 30 minutes. Pour the water and grains through a kitchen strainer into at least a 3 gallon pot. Rinse with 1/2 gallons of hot water, catching the rinse water in the pot. Discard the grains. Add another 1/2 gallon to the pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add 7 3/4 pounds of amber dry malt extract and dissolve completely. Return the pot to heat and bring to a boil (watch for boil-over). When malt mixture has settled into a nice boil, add the honey, boil and skim for 15 minutes. 



Have ready a fermenter with 3 gallons of cool water in it. Dump the honey/malt mixture into the cool water, aerate and pitch yeast when temperature is below 25 degrees C (77 F). It helps to cool the pot a bit before dumping into the fermenter. Proceed as above."

I sparged it into a brewpot by dumping the grains into a colander and running a bit of hot water through. I did recirculate once, but it was a clumsy process and I wouldn't swear that I did a thorough job of either extracting or filtering. 



I added the extracts and the boiling hops (the latter in a bag), and boiled it for a little over half an hour, then added the aromatic hops while I prepared the fermenter. This was the first time I used a hop bag. I don't know if it cuts down on the extraction from the pellets or not. I do know that it cut down on the mess in the fermenter.

Crush all the grain.



Put the 4 lbs of grain in a grain bag in 4 gal water. If you must use multiple bages, make sure each bag has it's proportion of munich malt; this is where the enzymes are. 



Heat the water to 160 and maintain for an hour and a half. Every 10 minutes or so wring out the grain bag, & stir it around. This may be cut to as short as one-half hour if you use an iodine test and it confirms conversion. 



WRinge out the grain and put it into a collender (sp?), sieve, or strainer over the water. Slowly pour another gallon (or whatever it takes to get to 5 gallons, depending upon how much you boil off, have already boilded, etc.) of 170 degree water through it to wash off remainng sugars.



Raise to boil, add hops and extract as usual.



Steam the oak chips to sterilie them--i put a bit of water into a pan, and hold them above in a strainer with a lid over it for about 10 minutes.



Toss the hops in the fermenter along with the wort,& add the oak as well (i suggest leaving them all in cheesecloth bags). transfer the oak chips to your secondary as well. If you use a keg, toss them in."

Calcium Carbonate (at end)","null","null","null","On 9/25/94, I put together the first three honeys listed along with a gallon of apricot juice and enough water to make 2.55 gallons. There was no reason for the strange selection of honeys; I was just cleaning out the cupboard. The apricot juice came from apricots from a tree in my backyard. I pureed the apricots to get a thick paste, froze the paste for about a year, then thawed it out and left it sitting in a gallon jug in a refrigerator for several months. >From past experience I knew that the solids would almost never clear out of the mead, so I waited until the juice separated and just used the clear juice. At any rate, I pasteurized this concoction for 90 min at 150 F and pitched the yeast. The SG was 1.115 and the must tasted rather sour, even with all that honey. I thought that I might need to correct the sourness somehow later. 



I didn't touch the mead again until 4/15/95 (my son was born on 10/20/94, so I was very busy). At this point I racked the mead, which was still sour, but had a nice apricot character. I measured the acid content at 1.3% as tartaric, 8.5 ppt as sulphuric. The SG was 1.001 and the clarity was good. 



On 5/16/95 I removed a sample and adjusted its acidity to 6.5% tartaric with CaCO3, decided that was too much (too chalky) and tried to adjust acidity of whole volume to 9.25% tartaric by adding one ounce of CaCO3. I measured it to be 9.3%. I then added sodium benzoate to kill the yeast and some extra clover honey (20 min at 160 F with 1 pt water) to counteract the residual acidity and give honey character. I let it sit overnight for the chalk to precipitate out before bottling. 



I entered this melomel in the 1995 NM State Fair as part of their wine competition (8/27/95). It received a Gold Medal and a score of 6.80/10, which was the highest rated mead, and the second highest rated wine (highest was 7.04). Judges noted excellent acidity-sweetness balance, good apricot and honey character, some spiciness (maybe the Questa honey?), and some sediment (the chalk), but otherwise good clarity. In the future I will try to wait until the chalk precipitates out to bottle, but at that time I needed to free up the carboy. You can see a chalk layer in the bottom of each bottle, but the mead can be easily decanted off of it."

I cooked the rice separately for about two hours until it was all ""mush"". I then added ""rice hulls"" to help with the lauterning. I also would hold back the pound of carapils and added this to the rice mash as well. I would time all this so I was adding the rice mash to my regular mash just before vorloof. A lot of hassle and yes, I did have some ""stuck"" mashes. I've brewed at least 25 batches with the rice flakes and not one stuck mash!","I set the mash to rest at 156-158. Yes, a little sweet but it is a ""cream ale""! I let the mash rest for 30-35 minutes. Vorloff untill it is clear (which is 2-4 minutes on my system) and then go to kettle.



I built a separate ""whirlpool"" vessel from another 1/2 Bbl keg so I can move my finished wort from the kettle as soon as I KO the fire. I can rinse the kettle and make way for my second batch. I add the 65 min hops to the whirlpool as soon as I start pumping over to it, which takes 7 minutes with my march pump. I am ready for the second mash to go to kettle 10 minutes from KO. With this system I can brew two batches, fill up my 35 gallon fermenter (a converted conical chemical tank) to 27 gallons, clean up and be out of my brewery in less than 8 hours! 20-25 days later I have 5 corney kegs of great tasting, polished and conditioned beer to help recover from all my hard work."

For the next hop addition, add 1/4 ounce of Mt Rainer hops with 15 minutes left in the boil into the kettle. For the final addition, add 1 ounce of Cascade hops with 8 minutes left in the boil. Cool down as fast as possible using a wort chiller or by putting the whole kettle in an ice bath. Make sure everything that touches the wort is sanitized well. Carefully pour the wort into a 5-6 gallon sanitized carboy. pitch activated wyeast smack pack (American Ale II Activator Wyeast ACT1272- 4.25 oz.) into the carboy. Let the beer ferment for a week, then siphon off to secondary. If you would like to, dry hop with cascade hops. Let the beer ferment in the secondary for 2 more weeks. Add 4oz of table sugar to bottling bucket, then siphon beer into bottling bucket. Bottle beer and let condition. when pouring, make sure to not pour out the last bit of beer, because this will usualy contain a yeasty sediment.

I only collected about 4.5 galons of wort because I don't have a big enough brew pot. I was within a point or two of my target OG based on my assumed efficiency of 85% of Dave Miller's optimal numbers. I boiled about 3.5 gal wort with the hops in a 4 gal pot. In another pot I boiled the remaining sweet wort and added it to the main pot as space became available. 



All hops were whole hops from the Hop Source (good hops, good prices, no financial or personal interest). I adjusted my IBU calculations for the estimated SG in the main pot. I assumed a more-or-less linear increace in SG between the SG at the start of the boil and the estimated SG at the time I added all runnings to the main pot. When calculating the IBUs for the early additions I did not try to take into account the dramatic boost in OG over the last 25 minutes of the boil caused by the addition of the LME. 



I cooled the wort over 40 minutes time in a covered kettle in a tub-full of cold water. Yeast was pitched at about 75F. Fermenation proceeded at 60F. Racked to carboy after 5 days, dry hopped for 8 before bottling."

Sanitize! Sanitize!

I know most of you have heard it before, but sanitize everything with a bleach solution or a commercial sanitizer. Bleach and sanitizers will come with instructions on how to dilute to be the most affective. This means pots, utensils, fermenting appliance, bottles, and pretty much anything that is not going directly into your brew. If you win the sanitation battle you will make a good brew 90% of the time. Now, on to the instructions...



-Pour roughly 1 gallon of cold spring water into fermenter

-Bring to boil the remaining water and ingredients in a large pot (this is the wort)

-Pour ""wort"" into your fermenter, add brewers' yeast and cover (not air tight)

-Wait at least a week before you taste test. It should taste yeasty or like flat beer, not sweet.

-Bottle your beer. Use extra fermentable sugar to give your beer its needed carbonation. Add 2.5 tsp sugar per 32 oz bottle.



Note: Put the hops in a coffee filter wrapped with a rubber band to avoid debris in your brew."

You asked for specific directions, so here goes:



1) heat about 2 gal of water in your brewpot. Steep the choc malt, special B, and special roast while the water heats up. Putting the grains in a msulin steeping bag helps make removing the grains a lot easier. 



2) When the water begins boiling, remove the grains, and add the amber syrup, dark syrup, and Northern Brewer hops. 



3) After 50 min, throw in the fuggle hops, and boil for 10 more minutes.

If your extraction rates are routinely below mine, add grain accordingly in your recipe. Just add to the two-row, don't bother to adjust the specialty malts, its just not necessary. My water is fairly soft, and slightly alkaline. I use two tsp gypsum in my mash water. Your mileage, of course, may vary. If you want a 1055 beer, lose 1# of two-row. But I like mine at 1060.

Hit your smack pack and let it swell. Boil 1/2 cup-3/4 of a cup of dry light malt for 15-20 minutes. Cool wort and pitch your yeast into a 1/2 gallon or 2 liter container with bung and airlock. Do this 24-36 hours before brew day. Either the night before or the morning of the brew day refrigerate the starter. Yeast will drop to bottom and you can decant most of the beer off the top (save a few ounces above the yeast bed). Let yeast warm to room temp and swirl vigorously. Pitch when ready. 



Batch Sparged Mash

Heat strike water to 166 degrees F. Fill mash/lauter tun. Dough-in grist and stir thoroughly. When temp reaches 154 degrees F close the lid and mash for 45 minutes. Drain about a Liter off the batch and recirculate to settle the grain bed (2-3 times). Drain the mash completely. The grain will absorb about 1 gallon of water. Your next strike water should be enough water to get you to 5 1/2-6 gallons. Heat to 164 degrees F and strike, stir grain. Follow the same recirculation process and draining as before.



At boil add Hallertaur hops (I know they are a flavoring hop) for 60 minutes. With 15 minutes left of the 60 minute boil add the Cascade hops. At this point, also add the tbs of Irish Moss. With this yeast you only really have to get the temp below 100 degrees (under 90 is best) to pitch. This yeast loves warmer temps. 70-80 degrees gives the yeast a slight fruity ester. The brew fermented very fast (5 days) with a vigorous fermentation.



The beer end up at 5.9% ABV."

Scotch ale needs a high pitching rate. 



MASH: Use a single step infusion mash for all 12 lbs. of grain. Mill grains and add to 3 gallons Artesian water at 180 degrees F in the mash tun. Mash should stabilize at ~158 degrees F. The mash should be on the thick side. Hold temp at about 158 degrees F for 90 minutes for conversion. Stir in the roasted barley about 5 minutes before sparging. Sparge with 5 gallons water initially at 180 degrees F. This will stop conversion for the mash out. Sparge slowly for about 45 minutes. You should get about 5.5-6.0 gallons of wort. 



BOIL: Total boil time 90 minutes. Bring to a boil rapidly and stir after 2-3 minutes. This will lightly carmelize the wort to enhance the flavor. Add all 5 ozs. of hops. Scotch ale does not have a flavor or aroma hop profile. Keep a rolling boil and stir well for good hop utilization. You will lose about 1 gallon of water to evaporation. Add Irish moss about 15 minutes before the end of the boil. Cool in cold water sink bath or wort chiller. Filter into primary fermenter and cool to 75 deg. F. 



FERMENT: Pitch yeast starter. Rack to secondary after 5-8 days. Leave in secondary until fermentation is complete. Bottle and condition at ~60 degrees F for six to eight weeks."

o Clean all brew tanks, pots and pans to be used, strainer, airlocks and hydrometer with boiling water and set aside.

o Gather all ingredients and weigh out the correct amount as follows:



BREWING



o Heat a stock pot of water to 70C and then remove from heat

o Add all grains to the stock pot in a hops bag, cover and allow to steep for 20 minutes.

o While ingredients are steeping; rehydrate the yeast by stirring it into 2 cups of 35C water (which you have already boiled), in a glass container then cover with cling film and set aside

o Once the grains have been steeped, remove them from the water and bring the water to a boil

o Prepare the hops for addition 

o	Full measure of Progress hops

o	2 half measures of Styrian Golding hops

o Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the Pale malt extract

o When the extract has completely dissolved return the pot to a boil

o Add the Progress hops and one of the Styrian Golding hops 

o Begin timing the one-hour-boil

o Tend the pot and watch for the Hot break 

o After 45 minutes of boiling add the second measure of Styrian Golding hops 

o When the one-hour-boil is over put the lid on the pot, and remove from the heat

o Cool the wort to between 18C and 32C as quickly as possible by placing the pre-boiled ice in the wort and stirring until the ice has melted (0.7kg of ice per litre of boiling wort)

o Check that the water in the brew tank has cooled, if not then add sterilized ice.

o Add the rehydrated yeast to the brew tank 

o Add the wort to the brew tank by pouring it through a strainer

o Top up the brew tank with cool water if necessary (ALREADY BOILED!)

o Sterilize the hydrometer

o Take a hydrometer reading and make note of the original gravity ________________

o Seal the brew tank and move it to its final location (pick somewhere which stays at 18C-23C)

o Once finished moving the tank, insert the airlock. 

o Fill the airlock to the fill line with coloured water

o Boil a large pot of water and freeze it so it may be used during the next brew to cool the wort.



Bottling



o	Gather materials

o	Boil a large pot of water to use for sterilizing 

o	Boil a medium sized pot of water for the priming sugar

o	Prepare the priming sugar

o	dissolve 2.5 grams of sugar per 500ml bottle in as little boiling water as possible and leave to cool

o	Sterilize mixing tool

o	Sterilize the hydrometer

o	Remove the airlock from the brew tank and move it to the correct location for bottling 

o	Open the tank and measure the final gravity ________________

o	Add the priming sugar

o	Gently mix the priming sugar into the beer and reseal the tank

o	Allow 30 minutes for the beer to settle

o	Sterilize all bottles to be used with a steam gun

o	Sterilize all crown caps to be used 

o	Sterilize siphon tubing, sediment trap and siphon valve

o	Prepare siphon for use by filling with hot water

o	After the beer is settled; re-open the brew tank and insert the siphon

o	Begin filling bottles

o	Cap and label all bottles and pack in boxes

o	Leave boxes at 18-25C for 2 weeks before drinking"

Boil 1.3 quarts of water per pound of grain. (I used 4 gallons which was pretty dead on if you use .5 lbs of American Chocolate and Pumpkin.) 3.5 gallons is not enough water and will leave your mash around 148F.

Mash @ 152-154F for and hour. I like my beer drier so, 152F is the temperature I find just right.

If you are using an 8-10 lb pumpkin, cut up the gourd, discard the innards, and roast or microwave the pieces until soft and cooked through. Mash the peeled, cooked pumpkin flesh with the grains for the hour.

Heat water for sparging while waiting. I heated 8-9 gallons to 190F. It's amazing how quick the temperature drops when sparging with grain and pumpkin. Best temperature is 170F for about 10 minutes.

But, I need to add some calcium to avoid overextraction of tannins, as well as some sulfate and chloride to improve taste. Adjust as necessary for your water. With that out of the way: Bring about 9 gals of water to 172F or so and mash-in all the crushed grains plus the potassium bisulfite in your tun. I use a 5-gal round insulated Igloo water cooler. (One of these days, I'm going to get a 10-gal one.) Add what you think is the right amount of water to the grains in your tun. Starting temp on the mash should be 150-152F. Stir every 15 min until 1 hour has elapsed. Pull a thick 40% or so and slowly bring it to a boil, then boil 10 min. It should take about 40 min to do this. Return it to the tun, stirring, and mash another 30 min. It will be 158F after you add the decoction back. Mash-out at 170F then lauter and sparge to get about 7.5 gals. I usually sparge with about 3.5 gals and add enough of the remaining sparge water to bring the volume up to the desired amount. Bring it to a boil, add the Tettnanger bittering hops and pay attention until hot break occurs. For some reason, this recipe tends to boil over easily. Add the Glacier flavoring hops and Irish Moss after 40 min has passed. Also, drop in your immersion chiller and connect the hoses but don't turn it on yet. Put your strainer in the boil, to get it sterilized too. Add the Glacier aroma hops and the candi syrup after 55 min has passed since the boil started. Turn the flame off 5 minutes later (total boil time = 60 min). Turn on the chiller water and drop the wort temp to 70F. Dump the yeast starter into your sanitized primary, strain out the hops as you pour into your primary, then pour back and forth between the boiling pot and primary two or three times to aerate the wort. Lock it up and put the primary where it will stay in the low to mid 70's. Make sure you have headspace in your primary - if using a carboy, be sure to use a blow-off type of airlock because the fermenation will be vigorous. Move to a secondary when things are slowing down after a few days, or leave it in the primary until the yeast has mostly dropped out. Bottle with 6-7 oz corn sugar. Give it a month in the bottle."

The mashing schedule that follows was for this amount not the actual amount that I used. So the mash was a little thicker than what it should have been. About 1.33 qts/lb.



Yeast starter began on 6/1/09 - 8pm - 2 qts of water, 2 cups DME, 1 tsp of yeast nutrient. Put on stir plate in cooler at 68F. Yeast was very active the next morning.



Added 22 quarts into tun for the Acid Rest, started 6/2/09 around 10:30am. The initial PH after Mash In was around 4.6, temp 98F. After 10 minutes PH was about 4.8, temp 98.7F. After 20 minutes PH was close to 5, temp 99F. After 30 minutes PH was around 5, temp 99.3. After 40 minutes PH was 5.1, temp 99.1F. After 50 minutes PH was 5.1, temp was 98.9. Acid Rest complete.



Saccharfication

Around 12pm 14 qt. of decoction (almost all grains were removed for decoction) was placed in pot and warmed to 158F in about 30 minutes. The pot was covered and wrapped in a blanket for 15 minutes. The decoction was then brought to boil in another 30 minutes. After a 10 minute boil, some decoction was moved to the Mash Tun to bring the Mash temp to 123F (Protein Rest). The remainder of the decoction continued to boil. Total boil time was 20 minutes. Total Protein Rest was 10 minutes. The remainder of the decoction was moved to the Mash Tun, temp of Mash was only 149F. Moved 6 qt from Mash Tun back into pot and brought to boil again. Once boiling was reached all decoction was placed in Mash Tun. Mash temp was 158F (Beta Amylase). Left at 158F for 15 minutes. Iodine check showed very little starch. Temperature of Mash dropped to 154F and it was left for another 15 minutes. The second idodine check showed no starch. 11 qt were moved to the pot and brought to boil for 5 minutes. After boil all 11 qt were moved back to the Mash Tun to bring Mash temp to 168F (Alpha Amylase) for 10 minutes.



Mash Out

9 qt of decoction moved to pot and brought to boil for 5 minutes. 5 qt were moved to Mash Tun to bring Mash temp to 173F for 10 minutes. Remainder of decoction was cooled to 173F and added to Mash Tun.



Sparge

7 gallons of water at 170F. Sparged until 6.75 gallons of wort were collected. When sparge was stopped the OG was still 1.018. Many sugars left in Mash.



Pre-Boil OG 1.064



Boil began at 4pm, hops were added. Took 35 minutes to cool wort to 73F. Wort was tranfered and stirred. Yeast was added and placed in cooler at 68F at 6:30pm.



Post-Boil OG 1.076, color was very close to estimated 15.8.



6/3/09 - Yeast are very active. Yeast backed into bubbler by morning. Bubbles are pushing liquid out the top of the bubbler. Another bubbler was added. Yeast again backed into bubbler by the afternoon. Another bubbler was added and yeast backed into it before I could get a blow off tube rigged up. Blow off tube in place around 6pm. Temperature in cooler around 68F.



Worked over the weekend.



On 6/8/08 (6 days in primary), moved to secondary. There was no bubbling from the primary before the transfer. Got a full 5 gallon carboy and one 16 oz. bottle from the primary. The gravity of the beer was 1.020. It was cloudy but the about the right color. The beer had good flavor but is still young.



Left town on 6/11/09 returned on 6/27/09, power in the house had went out, temperature controller was swinging from 78-85 everyday. Re-adjusted temperature controller back to 68 deg. Neighbors said electricity went out almost 2 weeks ago. So beer was in this swinging state for about 2 weeks.



6/28/09 added 5.2 oz. (by weight) to 2 cups water and boiled. Added beer to priming sugar in bucket and filled 39 - 16 oz bottles. Moved bottles to cooler at 68F. Beer was not as good as it was going into the secondary. Had a grainy feel and flavor.



7/6/09 drank one beer, color was close, carbonation was very low, the beer smelled ruined but tasted very good, alot of thick mouthfeel"

I usually ferment at 62-65 degrees for 10-14 days

Rack to keg (if bottling, ferment 14-20 days to settle it out, but this is much better enjoyed on tap if you have the means)

I let it secondary in the key for about a week before carbing and dispensing. 

For a slightly different experience, you can let it sit in a keg for 1-2 weeks at murky basement temp to naturally get a light carb - then dispense with just enough pressure to push it out and you have a bastardized version of real ale.



Enjoy!

Separately, finely grind the black patent malt and set aside. Bring 9 gals water with the gypsum and calcium chloride added to 170F. (Note: my water is very low in calcium, sulfate, and chloride. You may not need these additions. You should know your water analysis and act accordingly.) Grains should be crushed already. Mash in with 1.25 - 1.5 quart water per pound of grain to achieve 152F. Add the potassium bisulfite as you begin the dough-in. Mash 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Then, pull a 40% thick decoction and slowly bring it to a boil, taking about 30 minutes to get it there, then boil it for 10 min. Return the decoction to the tun and mash another 30 minutes, stirring once at 15 minutes. Then, transfer to a pot and mash-out at 170F. Return to your tun, adding the finely ground black patent malt, let it settle 15 minutes, then lauter and sparge with about 3.5 gals of the water. Bring to a boil, and watch out prior to the break because this recipe boils over very easily. After hot break occurs, boil for 1 hour, making all the other ingredient additions per the times shown above. Don't forget to put your chiller (strainer too, if you are using one) in at 20 minutes before flame-out to get it sterilized. Cool rapidly to 65 - 70F, aerate by pouring back-and-forth between your brewpot and primary fermenter (easy with a bucket primary, impossible with a carboy) two or three times, then pitch a big starter and airlock it. It will be ready to bottle or keg at about 2 wks from the start. I used 6 oz of corn sugar to bottle mine."

Crack the crystal in a blender or whatever you like to crack with (dont powderize it!) bring it to a boil with one gallon of cold water. At the first sign of a boil, strain the liquid into your normal boiling pot (dont squeeze, smish, or squish the grain... just let the wort run out). 



Add one gallon (or two if the pot is large enough) of water, the water salts, and extracts to the pot and bring to a boil. Boil for fifteen minutes, then add the boiling hops and continue boiling for 30 minutes (keep on stirring, but try to keep the pot covered as much as possible). 



Add the Irish moss, stir for one minute. 



Add the finishing hops. Stir and cover for three minutes. 



Place (chill first if you like) in the fermenter and top to 5.5 gallons. 



Pitch when cool (as if you didnt know this part). 



I normally use a two stage system. I'll rack it once after the head falls. When the bubbler pharts 2 or less times per minute, i'll bottle or keg. If you are bottling, i would suggest using somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 cup corn sugar, or 1/2 cup of honey for priming... I hope i didnt forget anything... 



Note: If you serve this beer to newbies or wimps, serve it COLD! most beer lovers will enjoy it warm to cool also!"

Steep 2.0 gallons of water with 4 oz. of Black Roasted Barley, 1.75 lbs. British Pale Malt and 1 lb. Crystal 60L Malt for 30 minutes with the heat on low. (154 degrees F is the preferred temperature). Heat in a second pot 3.0 gallons of water to 170 degrees F. After 30 minutes at 150-154 degrees F, strain out the grain and sparge the grain with 3.0 gallons of 170 degrees F water. Turn the heat to high, add more water to the pot to get to 6 gallons and bring the liquor to a boil. Remove the pot from the burner and add 2 cups malt of malt extract. Return to burner to get to a boil, dissolve the malt extract and add 1.0 oz. of Willamette hops. Boil for 60 minutes total duration. With 15 minutes to go in the boil, add 1.0 oz. Willamette hops. Clean and assemble the wort chiller and place into the hot wort to sanitize it. At flameout, add remainder of malt extracts and stir to mix, wait 10 minutes to sanitize (late extract addition method). Make sure the wort temperature stays above 165 degrees F while the malt extracts are dissolving. When all the extract is dissolved and sanitized, move the brewpot to the kitchen sink, connect the hose to the wort chiller inlet, turn on the water faucet to pass cold water through the hose and cool the wort. The tubing outlet goes in the kitchen sink. When the wort is cooled, transfer and strain the wort into the sanitized carboy, then top off to the 5.25 gallon mark as needed with additional cold (preboiled) water. Seal the fermenter with a sanitized stopper. Mix the wort well and take the original gravity measurement and wort temperature and record. Open the fermenter and pitch (pour) the rehydrated yeast solution in when wort is cooled to under 74 degrees F. Stopper and mix well again. Open the fermenter and put the sanitized aeration stone in the wort and aerate the wort and yeast for 30 minutes minimum. Remove the aeration stone. Apply sanitized stopper with fermentation lock, fill fermentation lock partially with water and cover fermenter with a blanket. Ferment at 60-66 degrees F in the dark. Try to get the fermentation temperature as close to 60 degrees F as you can and stable. Bubbling should start within 24 hours. Primary fermentation should last at least 10 days or until the bubbling has subsided to once every minute. Be sure to let the wort rest in the primary fermenter for a couple days after fermentation has finished. Transfer wort to a sanitized secondary fermenter. After siphoning all the wort, place the sanitized fermentation lock on the fermenter and partially fill the lock with water. Record temperature and final volume of beer for secondary fermentation. Hold secondary fermenter at 60-66 degrees F in the dark closet or cool basement or garage. Try to keep fermentation temperatures as constant as possible. After two weeks or when the secondary fermentation is done (this beer should be dark but clear), clean and sanitize 55+ bottles with dilute Iodophor for bottling. Sanitize siphon, carboy, spoon, beer thief, thermometer, bottle filler and 60 bottle caps. Prepare priming solution by bringing 2 cups of water to a boil and adding 3/4 cup corn sugar to dissolve. Cool priming solution and add to clean and sanitized bottling bucket (carboy). Take the final gravity measurement from the secondary fermenter, wort temperature and record. After secondary fermentation is done, siphon beer into the bottling bucket (carboy). Mix the beer and priming sugar in the bottling bucket with paddle end of spoon. Add the bottle filler to end of siphon tubing and make sure this assembly is sanitized afterwards in Iodophor. Begin siphoning beer into bottles. Place caps loosely on each bottle after filled. After all bottles are filled, use bottle capper to cap each bottle. Place bottles in warm dark place to carbonate. Hold bottles for a total two weeks in room temperatures (68 degrees F+) to carbonate. After the carbonation period, place bottled beer in a refrigerator to cool. Serve by decanting beer into a beer glass when a cold brew is desired. Enjoy it!"

Mash using you favorite technique, but keep it short - 1hr or so. Sparge w 170 F water (acidified). Do not recirculate excessively. The short mash and the pilsner malt will help avoid a stuck runoff. Bring the wort to a boil as quickly as posssible. Normally I boil 30 min to coagulate the protein before I add hops, but i in this case, add the hops right at the start of the boil, or even before. Use Goldings. Add the soured beer - preferably soured from a lactic infection. Boil 1 hour, or 45 min if you used hop pellets instead of plugs. Cool & pitch Wyeast 1084 Irish ale yeast starter. SG should be 1.045-1.050 or so, unless you get spectacular extraction rates (I don't). Ferment 60-65F. 



Now if you bottle, use 3-4 oz corn sugar and let condiiton. If you keg, you've got an added element in how you imitate guinness: Chill the beer to 50F, & turn the pressure up to 10-15 PSI & Serve. Do not agitate the keg. The beer will have a head, but very little carbonation in the beer itself, just like guinness."

Bring to a boil, add 2 oz of the Styrian Goldings. Boil 30 minutes, add the two cans of syrup, and the teaspoon of Irish Moss. Boil for 28 minutes more, add the remaining 1/2 oz of Styrian Goldings. Boil two more minutes, and turn off heat. 



Usual procedure for wort cooling, addition of the yeast (pre-prepared) and bottling (use 3/4 cup corn sugar for bottling). 



I chose to add the Maple syrup ONLY after 30 minutes, mostly because I was a bit worried that the wort my overflow because of the syrup (that stuff, boiled solo, will almost always overflow!). I was also concerned that the syrup would be ""over-cooked"". You may want to put it into the brew kettle at first. 



My fermentation was rather FAST, it took about 36 hours, and at that point, the air lock was only going about once every 2 minutes. I bottled on the 10th day, to be sure. 



My O.G. was 1.070, but it may vary depending on the syrup you use. My F.G. was 1.020, and again, it may vary. I found that he color of the Porter will be mostly black, with a slight pull towards brown."

When it had cooled t o about 80F, I added 2 packets of premier couvee yeast, poured it off into a half-gallon jug, capped it & shook. Within an hour, the lid was chattering away happily. 



After sterilising everything, I brought 2 G of spring water to a boil, added 4 quarts of tupelo honey from the local co-op, brought it up to 180F & kept it there for 30 min. Turned off the stove & added the ""acid blend"". I thought the lemon would be a n ice note w/ the tupelo, and the cranberries' tartness a nice contrast. The tea was added for 'depth' (?). Then the hulls & energiser got stirred well in, and the whole thing sat in an ice bath in the sink for an hour or so. 



Poured the must into 1.5 gallons of cold water, & quickly scooped some up for the gravity test: 1.100, on the nose! The flavor is much milder than I'd expected, and there's less of a sense of sweetness than my other musts (generic/1.1225, orange/1.090). 



I still have a quart of that same honey, and I'll probably be feeding this one as it goes along, if the premier couvee is as attenuative as everyone says.

The lack of hardness in the water is crucial to the flavor.

Add 7 gallons of cool water to the grist, and allow the grain to soak for 30 minutes, stirring every 8-10 minutes to ensure thorough hydration. Apply heat to your brewpot to slowly raise, and hold the temperature at 100-105 degrees. Use a large ladle to carefully remove the thickest 40% of the mash, and carefully transfer to a second pot, being careful not to splash. There should be just enough liquid in this decoction to cover the grain.

Slowly raise and hold the temperature of the decoction at 120-122 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring often to prevent scorching. Rapidly raise and hold the temperature of the decoction to 154 degrees for 20 minutes, or untill the iodine test shows complete conversion. Quickly bring the decoction to a hardboil, and boil 15 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid scorching. Carefully ladle the hot decoction into the rest of the mash, avoiding splashing, until the temperature of the mash reaches 127-128 degrees. If any of the hot dcoction is left over, put the pot in a cool water bath untill it cools to the appropriate temperature. Hold the mash at 128 degrees for 15 minutes before drawing the next decoction. 

Carefully remove the thickest 50% of the mash, and transfer it to the second pot. Quickly raise and hold the temperature of the decoction at 154 degrees for 20 minutes, or until conversion is complete. Rapidly bring the decoction to a boil for 15 minutes. Add the decoction to the mash to reach a temperature of 152 degrees. Hold the mash at 152 degrees for 15 minutes, or untill conversion is complete. Raise the mash temp to 170 degrees to mash out.

Prepare 8-9 gallons of brewing water, heated to 168 degrees. Sparge, recirculating the first running untill they come out clear. Sparge slowly, untill kettle full (a little over 5.5 gallons of wort) Avoid aeration. 

Bring the wort to a hard boil for 15 minutes, and add 2.25oz bittering hops, boil another 60 minutes. Add .5 oz flavoring hops during he last 15 minutes, and .25 oz during the last 5 minutes of boiling. Use a long plastic or metal spood to whirlpool the wort, taking care not to splash. When the hot trub settles into the center of the pot, slowly siphon the wort off of the hot trub. 

Rapidly cool the wort down to 42 degrees (less than 3 hours). Aerate the cooled wort and pitch the yeast. Add .5 ozz hops to the secondary fermentor to dryhop.

You may have to adjust the malt and water quantities based on the efficiency of your system. You can use a step-infusion mash using rest temperatures of 30min@125, 20min@144, and 20min@154. It will not have the same character as the decoction method."

24 oz of raspberries gives a fairly subtle beer, with a mild tart raspberry underpinning that all of my friends loved. 36 oz of berries give a more assertive, but not overwhelming, raspberry flavor.

If you desire a little more of a pine taste do one shot glass Amarillo and one Cascade. Save the shot glasses full of hop pellets for the last 3 minutes.

You can do higher but anything over 105 degrees seems to kill all the yeast. I have found if you place the yeast vial in you pocket for the whole time of the boil and cooling of the wort the yeast does not go into shock from the temp, especially if you can't wait for the wort to cool to 80 degrees. Put the wort in to the fermenting container and add cool aerated water up to 5 gallons. 10 days in primary fermentation container then rack into secondary fermentation container ferment 2 weeks, longer if needed to clear the beer.

Clean & Sanitize, Sanitize, Sanitize all brewing equipment.



Crush or mill all the grains. Let the liquid malt extract warm to room temperature. Each grain should be COARSELY crushed and broken open.



Put 2.5 gallons of purified water into brew pot 1, and 1 gallon of purified water into pot 2. Set the remaining 1/2 gallon of water aside, for later use. Bring the temperature in pot 1 to 115F degrees. Pour the 2-row grains into a brew bag, tie off and place into brew pot 1. Pour the caramel/Gabrinus grains into a brew bag, tie off and place into brew pot 1. Keep at 115F degrees for 15 minutes. At 15 minutes, increase brew pot 1 temp to 150F degrees for 30 minutes. At 30 minutes, turn off the heat in brew pot 1. Bring brew pot 2 to 150F degrees. Turn off the heat in brew pot 2. Lift the 2-row grain bag above the liquid in brew pot 1. Pour 1/2 of the water from brew pot 2 over the 2-row grains, slowly. Lift the caramel/Gabrinus grain bag above the liquid in brew pot 1. Pour remaining 1/2 of the water from brew pot 2 over the 2-row grains, slowly. Discard the oats and bring the now milky, almost pudding-like water in pot 1 to a boil. ~ no longer using pot 2 ~



Remove pot 1 from heat. Dissolve the 7 lbs of liquid malt extract into the brew pot. Put ½ oz of the Whitbread hops into the mash. Bring to a rolling boil for 30 minutes; checking the heat and stirring occasionally.



At 30 minutes, add the remaining ½ oz of Whitbread hops; checking the heat and stirring occasionally.



During the next 20 minutes, crush the 1/2 lb secret ingredient into the smallest pieces that you can.



At 50 minutes, stir the crushed secret ingedient and the Whirlfloc into the wort: ensuring that they dissolve completely. Add the Citra hops and 1/2 oz secret ingredient. Boil for another 10 minutes; checking the heat and stirring occasionally.



Turn off the heat. Remove pot 1 from burner. Cool the wort immediately! Temp must be 70-78 degrees Fahrenheit; usually when the brew pot is slightly cool to the touch.



Clean & Sanitize, Sanitize, Sanitize all brewing equipment.



Using a hydrometer, check the gravity. Top off (with remaining 1/2 gallon of purified water). Splash into fermenter # 1. Pitch your yeast! Stir well. Seal fermenter #1 and add an airlock or blow off tube.



Place fermenter #1 into a dark(ish) room at about 65-70F degrees. You should get bubbling activity within 24 hours. Leave it alone until bubbling stops (usually appx 7 days). When the bubbling stops, check the fermentation. If there is a ""hairy"" layer of foam on the top of the beer: throw it away! Otherwise, using a sanitized strainer, scoop any foam from the top of the beer, take a hydrometer reading and taste. If all seems well, rack to fermenter #2. DO NOT SPLASH! Seal fermenter #2, add an airlock and wait another 7 days. ~ no longer using fermenter #1, so clean/sanitize it and put it away ~



At 7 days, with sanitized brewing equipment, take a final gravity reading. Taste. Rack (gently) to a bottling bucket. Add 3/4 cup priming sugar; mix well (do not splash). Bottle (sanitized bottles) and condition for 14-28 days.

After the Hour boil with potatoes, Add 1.5 gallons Hot tap water and check temp. Should be about 190 F let water rest and wait for temp to get down to 168F. Remove potatoes, then in a grain bag add the 4 lbs of oats, let this sit for about 1 hour. Then remove the grain bag and run the hot wort over the grain in a sparge bucket, cooler or whatever of your choice.



When Wort runs clear, Add 2 more gallons of Hot tap water to rinse grain and collect add to boil wort, you should have about 6 Gallons of Wort now. 



Add your Hops now, 1 Oz Chinnook and 1 Oz German Traditional boil 1 hour, At 15 min left add the rest of the Chinnook and the Irish Moss and the DME, I know its a little early for the DME but youll want a little carmelization from your wort.

You could shade the color of the beer and add complexity by replacing a small amount of the pilsner malt with carapilsner or carvienne malt; likewise a touch of malted wheat could be used to advantage.

Skim off the scum. 



When cool, add yeast nutrient, energizer and pitch a large volume of liquid yeast culture. For the higher honey content meads, use a more alcohol tolerant yeast. Traditionally, mead was a sweet drink, not dry (though I do have some documentation suggesting that dry meads were not unheard of). 



If you like you can add all sorts of stuff: 



1-5 sticks cinnamon 1/4-1/2 oz. allspice (or however you spell it) 1/2-3 oz. fresh grated ginger root (takes longer to age, but then again, so do all meads) And a whole bunch of other types of stuff 



Whatever you decide to add (if anything), do not add it to the simmering honey/water (called must). Make a tea and then add that to the carboy. One thing, some recipes you will run across (the Cats Meow comes to mind), say to add hops. Ick. Hops belong in beer, not in mead. Mead does not need the preservative antiseptic qualities of hops, honey does that quite nicely. Nor does mead need the hop bitterness to balance the sweetness of the honey. Mead SHOULD be sweet (either just a little or a whole bunch, depending on the type). 



On the second day shake the carboy vigorously. This stimulates yeast growth. Since mead is somewhat slow to ferment (I had one batch actively bubbling away for a year and a half), it needs all the help it can get. Shake it once a day till you get out gassing, then stop. At this point, shaking the carboy can put mead on the ceiling. 



The most important thing to remember about mead is that it is slow. Slow to ferment, slow to clear, and slow to age. A batch can take several weeks to get started (if you don't use yeast nut. and energizer), several months to ferment to completion, and several years to age."

After secondary fermentation was complete I decided it should be hoppier and added the 2nd oz. of hallertau pellets. 3 days later I reconsidered and racked off the hops. I further decided to test out the scrubbing bubbles theory of hops reduction - I boiled 1 cup of corn sugar and steeped another tsp orange peel and added it - got a fairly vigorous fermentation for several more days.



1 week after the corn sugar fiasco I added another 3/4 cup and bottled. Pretty good, hops are just about right, pretty light on the coriander and orange peel. Very tasty after about 2 weeks in the bottle."

No reviews","Soft Seattle Water","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","I brewed 12 gallons of 1.073 wort and then added 13 gallons of boiled, cooled, aerated water to my primary fermenter. (BTW, this was a 32 gallon food grade plastic ""trash can"" open fermenter.) In order to keep the body and flavor of the beer up, I boiled for almost 2 hours, and my mash went for saccharification at about 158F. I also chose to use Wyeast 1028, which has a very distinctive, woody character, so that the beer wouldn't turn out bland and uninteresting. 



Sparge with 8 gal. untreated soft water. Boil off 3.75 gal. during two hours, adding ~24 IBUs of Kent Goldings hops (based on the final volume of the beer, in this case it was 170 gm of 6% alpha acid pellets). 



The yeast starter was stepped up twice, with a quart and then a half gallon of wort starter. The primary finished in 4 days at 60F, and I racked into carboys for a week of clarification before kegging. 



The FG was 1.010, for a batch of beer that was about 3.2% by volume, or about 2/3rds the strength of a standard beer. It was a dark brown in color, with a sweet initial palate and a (relatively) full body and a dryish finish. The yeast character showed through in the middle, although there wasn't a lot of fruitiness, probably due to the low fermentation temperatures."

I took the gr ain off the grill before it got roasted dark because I figured that would give it more of a porter-like flavor that I was not looking for.



My notes do not include a mashing schedule, but since my temperature control in my mashing setup isn't very good, it probably wouldn't do much good. 



I used a very old package of Whitbread dry yeast as I had trouble with my Wyeast starter. It worked out OK but I would suggest using Wyeast 1007 German Ale as I had originally intended."

**Syphon by putting water in the hose closer to the end the beer is going to pour into the bottle, place the other end into the beer, and let go. This is a safer alternative to just sucking with your mouth, because It is more prone to spoilage when the yeast is not active.**

Add hops following traditional German hop schedule: 2 ounces of Saaz 60 minutes before end of boil, 1 ounce 30 minutes before end of boil, and 1 ounce in last 10 minutes of boil. You could probably hop a bit more agressively than indicated. You might make a final aroma addition of another 0.5-1 ounce of Saaz right before end of boil. You also might consider dryhopping.

Canned pumpkin dissolves into a horrendously fine mush that will settle to the bottom of your primary and cause you to lose up to 1 gallon or more (it does not firmly settle out.) Are the results worth it? I think so, but I will only do 2 or 3 pumpkin brews a year for the holidays, because it is messy.

Allow to settle for a few days after the fermentation ceases, then rack into quart bottles, adding one level teaspoonful of sugar to each bottle. Seal the bottles, store in a warm place for 2-3 days to ensure that bottle fermentation begins, then move to a cooler location to assist clarification. Subsequently treat as a bottled beer. Priming is not essential, and, after fermentation, the ale mead may be matured as a draught beer and drunk after a few months."

Columbus pellets","The second batch contained:","1# Crystal","I basically brewed these two batches in one day as two separate beers. The first was as follows: Boil 3oz. of Columbus pellets and set aside. cut the rind off of the gratefruits. Bake 1 1/2 cups of the apple wood chips in the oven on a really high temperature for 20 minutes or so. They need to be pretty hot but not burned. Soak the rinds and the chips in chardonay for a while, maybe an hour. Steep the Crystal and Vienna for a while. Combine all of it into the brew pot and boil it like any other recepie. At the end throw in another oz of Columbus pellets.



On the other batch I did the following:

Scrape out all of the watermellon insides and, using huge spoons, press the hell out of big chunks of watermellon parts. The put all of the watermellon juice and pressed pulp into a huge bowl. Steep the grains for a while. Add the steeped grains to the pot, bring to a boil and add other malts. After a while add 3 oz. of Columbus for bittering. Towards the end add the Amarillo and the Liberty haphazardly for around 15 minutes. 



Cool them. Put them in your bucket. Add a vial of yeast that the guy at the local home brew store said would go good with these recepies. Ale yeast. Let them ferment for a few days. If I remember correctly I removed the wood chips but left the watermellon parts. Move them both to a carboy for a couple of weeks. Just before you bottle them, get a third bucket and just start pouring both beers back and forth and try to mix them up completely. Then bottle them. 

All I can say is that I wish I had more. It is going to be hard to recreate this beer. Good luck to you."

Boosted the temperature of the mash to 155 without any protein rest. I had used about 3 teaspoons of gypsum to get the mash down to a PH of about 5.0. 



Put in insulated box for 2 1/2 hours. Ending temp was 145. The requirement was for two hours, but getting the sparge water ready took longer than I wanted. Then I boosted to 168 degrees for mash-out. (iodine test showed complete conversion).



For the sparge water, I used an 8% Phosporic acid solution to acidify 6 gallons of hot tap water. After 2 tsps, my PH strips looked like they were still above 6.0. Then, on the 3rd teaspoon, the PH abruptly changed, and the test strips remained yellow, indicating that it was now very acidic. I had to add about 3 more gallons of water before it got back up to about 5.0. 



I was expecting just a slow trickle for the sparge, but once I opened the spigot on my lauter tun, the wort hissed out. (Used the cylindrical cooler with sparge bag on SS vegetable strainer) It never did slow to a trickle as I was expecting. I slowed the flow of the output and input so that the sparge would take about an hour. (The water was 168 degrees, Re-circulated 1st runnings until clear) NOTE: I don't think the water was leaking thru the sides of the sparge bag, and it looked like it *was* filtering through the grain bed OK, which was always held in suspension. 



Collected about 8 gallons of wort (ph of the runnings never dropped below 5.8 even though the gravity dropped to about 1.010) and boiled for 90 minutes. A gravity reading before the boil showed only about 1.020 (granted, it was 8 gallons) prompting me to add 1 lb DME. I thought I had boiled down to 5 gallons, but was actually 6. (Haven't put any sort of volume markings in my Sankey keg boiler yet). Used a CF chiller, shook the 6 1/2 gal car-boy for about 5 minutes to oxygenate and pitched yeast. FG was only 1.032 at 60 deg F. 



No activity for 24 hours. After about 2 days, the krausen remained only about 2 inches (My weakest ferment ever). Since my first ""mostly-grain"" batch had a tremendous amount of gray gunk floating on top of the foam, I definitely wanted it to blow out of my car-boy which had about 6 inches of head space. So I added about 1 tsp *each* of Yeast nutrient, Yeast energizer, and Amylase enzyme to 180 degree water and then dumped it in. Also, I swirled the contents around in the carboy hoping to get the yeast more active. BTW, I have no idea what the nutrient and energizer consist of."

It is the adjuncts and unfermentables in this batch that give it that special holiday/winter character. I will definanely try this batch again...but before next winter!"

Mash malt, barley and gelatinized grains in moderately hard water at 150F for 1-1/2 hours. Raise to 168F to deactivate enzymes. Sparge with hot water (168F) to collect 250+ degrees of extract (e.g., 6 gallons at S.G. 1.042). 



Boil 1-1/2 hours, adding all but 1/2 ounce of hops after 1 hour, honey towards end of boil. Chill wort and add cold water to bring S.G. to 1.050. Pitch with working starter. Dry-hop with reserved hops in hopping bag. Primary fermentation takes 5-7 days. Wyeast 1007 will require 3-4 weeks in secondary fermenter to settle out. Bottle, then age 2 months. Drink and enjoy!"
